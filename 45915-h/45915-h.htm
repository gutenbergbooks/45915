<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Upper Burma was invaded and annexed in the year
1885. The work hardly occupied a month. In the
following year the subjugation of the people by the destruction
of all formidable armed resistance was effected; lastly,
the pacification of the country, including the establishment
of an orderly government with peace and security, occupied
four years.</p>

<p>As head of the civil administration, I was mainly concerned
with this last phase.</p>

<p>It would be a difficult task to give a continuous history of
the military operations by which the country was subjugated.
The resistance opposed to our troops was desultory, spasmodic,
and without definite plan or purpose. The measures
taken to overcome it necessarily were affected by these
characteristics, although they were framed on definite
principles. A history of them would resolve itself into a
number of more or less unconnected narratives.</p>

<p>A similar difficulty, but less in degree, meets the attempt
to record the measures which I have included in the
term "pacification." Certain definite objects were always
before us. The policy to be followed for their attainment
was fixed, and the measures and instruments by
which it was to be carried out were selected and prepared.
But I have found it best not to attempt to follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
any order, either chronological or other, in writing this
narrative.</p>

<p>My purpose in writing has been to give an intelligible
narrative of the work done in Burma in the years following
the annexation. It was certainly arduous work done under
great difficulties of all kinds, and, from the nature of the
case, with less chance of recognition or distinction than of
disease or death. The work was, I believe, well done, and
has proved itself to be good.</p>

<p>My narrative may not attract many who have no connection
with Burma. But for those who served in Burma
during the period covered by it, whether soldiers or civilians,
it may have an interest, and especially for those still in the
Burma Commission and their successors.</p>

<p>I hope that Field-Marshal Sir George White, V.C., to
whom, and to all the officers and men of the Burma Field
Force, I owe so much, may find my pages not without
interest.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to show how the conduct of the
soldiers of the Queen, British and Indian, helped the civil
administration to establish peace.</p>

<p>I believe, as I have said, that our work has been
successful. The credit, let us remember, is due quite as
much to India as to Britain. How long would it have
taken to subjugate and pacify Burma if we had not been
able to get the help of the fighting-men from India, and
what would have been the cost in men and money? For
the Burmans themselves I, in common with all who have
been associated with them, have a sincere affection. Many
of them assisted us from the first, and from the Upper
Burmans many loyal and capable gentlemen are now helping
to govern their country justly and efficiently.</p>

<p>It has been brought home to me in making this rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
record how many of those who took part in this campaign
against disorder have laid down their lives. I hope I may
have helped to do honour to their memories.</p>

<p>I have to thank all the kind friends who have sent me
photographs to illustrate this book, and especially Sir Harvey
Adamson, the present Lieutenant-Governor, for his kindness
in making my wants known.</p>

<div class="center"><big>THE PACIFICATION OF BURMA</big></div>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

THE ADMINISTRATION OF BURMA</h2>


<p>On the 20th of December, 1852, Lord Dalhousie issued a
proclamation annexing the province of Pegu to the
British Dominions. "The Governor-General in Council,"
he said, "having exacted the reparation he deems sufficient,
desires no further conquest in Burma and is willing that
hostilities should cease.</p>

<p>"But if the King of Ava shall fail to renew his former
relations with the British Government, and if he shall
recklessly seek to dispute its quiet possession of the province
it has now declared to be its own, the Governor-General in
Council will again put forth the power he holds and will
visit with full retribution aggressions, which, if they be
persisted in, must of necessity lead to the total subversion of
the Burman State and to the ruin and exile of the King and
his race."</p>

<p>In 1885 the fulfilment of this menace&mdash;prophecy it might
be called&mdash;was brought about by the contumacy of the
Government of Ava. The Burman State was "totally
subverted." Its territories were added to the British
Empire. The King and his race were "ruined and exiled."</p>

<p>At the end of November, 1885, the British commander
was in full possession of Mandalay, the capital. Our forces
had made a procession up the great river, which is the main
artery of the country, almost unopposed. Such opposition
as there had been was childish in its feebleness and want of
skill and purpose. Fortunately for us the King and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
ministers prided themselves on their voluntary army system.
King Thebaw was not going to compel his subjects to
defend their country. They were told to go about their
daily tasks without fear or carefulness. They might sleep
in their beds. He would see to it that the foreign
barbarians were driven into the sea whence they had
come. Unfortunately the soldiers to whom he trusted were
insufficiently trained, badly armed and equipped. He had
intended, perhaps, to remedy all this and to train his troops
for six months before the fighting began.</p>

<p>His enemy, however, was unreasonably hasty and had an
abundance of fast steamers for transporting the invading
force. Before the training could begin or the arms be
provided or the officers instructed, the invaders were before
Ava, where the bulk of the defending army had been collected,
and a few miles from the capital. The King's government
was as helpless as it had been arrogant and pretentious.
Ministers of State were sent down in hot haste with
messages of submission and surrender.</p>

<p>The army, however, took a different view of the case.
They refused to obey the order to surrender which had
come from Mandalay. Before General Prendergast could
land his men they dispersed over the country in every
direction with their arms, and as the British force had no
cavalry to pursue them, they got away to a man. At first
under various leaders, few of whom showed any military
talent, they waged a guerilla warfare against the invaders;
and afterwards, when their larger divisions had been defeated
and broken up, they succeeded in creating a state
of anarchy and brigandage ruinous to the peasantry and
infinitely harassing to the British.</p>

<p>On the 29th of November Mandalay was occupied and the
King a prisoner on his way down the river to Rangoon.
The waterway from Mandalay to the sea was under our
control. A few of the principal places on the banks of the
river had been held by small garrisons as the expedition
came up, and the ultimate subjugation of the Burman
people was assured. The trouble, however, was to come.</p>

<p>To a loosely organized nation like the Burmese, the occupation
of the capital and the removal of the King meant
nothing. They were still free to resist and fight. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
to be five years before the last of the large gangs was
dispersed, the leaders captured, and peace and security
established.</p>

<p>Burma will be, in all likelihood, the last important
province to be added to the Indian Empire. Eastward
that Empire has been extended as far as our arms can
well reach. Its boundaries march with Siam, with the
French dominion of Tongking, and on the East and North
for a vast distance with China. Our convention with
France for the preservation of the territory which remains
to Siam and our long friendship with the latter country
bars any extension of our borders in that direction. It is
improbable that we shall be driven to encroach on Chinese
territory; and so far as the French possessions are concerned,
a line has been drawn by agreement which neither
side will wish to cross.</p>

<p>In all likelihood, therefore, the experience gained in
Burma will not be repeated in Asia. Nevertheless it may
be worth while to put on record a connected account of
the methods by which a country of wide extent, destitute
of roads and covered with dense jungle and forest, in which
the only rule had become the misrule of brigands and the
only order systematic disorder, was transformed in a few
years into a quiet and prosperous State.</p>

<p>I cannot hope that the story will be of interest to many,
but it may be of some interest and perhaps of use to those
who worked with me and to their successors.</p>

<p>From 1852 to 1878 King Mindôn ruled Upper Burma
fairly well. He had seized the throne from the hands of
his brother Pagan Min, whose life he spared with more
humanity than was usual on such occasions. He was, to
quote from the Upper Burma Administration Report of
1886, "an enlightened Prince who, while professing no
love for the British, recognized the power of the British
Government, was always careful to keep on friendly terms
with them, and was anxious to introduce into his kingdom,
as far as was compatible with the maintenance of his own
autocratic power, Western ideas and Western civilization."
He was tolerant in religious matters even for a Burmese
Buddhist. He protected and even encouraged the Christian
missions in Upper Burma, and for Dr. Marks, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
representative of the Society for the Propagation of the
Gospel in Mandalay he built a handsome teak church
and a good clergy-house, giving a tinge of contempt to
his generosity by putting them down by the Burmese
burial-ground. The contempt was not for the religion but
for the foreign barbarians who professed it.</p>

<p>His measures for encouraging trade and increasing and
ordering the revenues were good, and the country prospered
under him. In Burma there are no hereditary leaders of
the people. There is no hereditary aristocracy outside the
royal family, and their descendants rapidly merge into
the people. There was no law or binding custom determining
the descent of the crown within the family. Every
one with royal blood, however little, in his veins was a
potential pretender. Whenever the crown demised the
succession was settled by intrigue or violence, and possible
aspirants were removed by the prince who had obtained
the prize. There was no other way of securing its peaceful
enjoyment.</p>

<p>Under the King was the Hlutdaw, or great Council of
State, composed of the Chief Ministers, who were appointed
by the King from the courtiers who had the good fortune
to be known to him or had helped him to the throne. To
each of these was assigned a province of the empire, which
he governed through a deputy.</p>

<p>The immediate power was vested in the deputy, who
resided in the province and remitted to the Minister as
much as he could collect over and above the amount due to
the crown and, it need hardly be said, necessary for his own
needs. The provinces were divided into townships, which
were ruled by officials appointed by the governors, no doubt
with regard to local influence and claims, and with a general
inclination to keep the office in a family.</p>

<p>The really stable part of the administration on which
everything rested was the village, the headship of which
was by custom hereditary, but not necessarily in the
direct line.</p>

<p>As there was little central control, it may be supposed
that under a system of this kind the people were pillaged,
and doubtless they were to some extent. But the deputy-governor
on the spot had no organized police or militia to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
support him. If he wanted to use force he had to pay for
it, and if he drove his province to the point of rebellion he
was unlikely to profit by it.</p>

<p>The amount of revenue was fixed at Mandalay with
reference to a rough estimate of what the province could
pay, and that was divided amongst the townships and again
amongst the villages. The headman of each village, assisted
by a committee or Punchayet, as it would be called in
India, settled the sum due from each householder, and this
was as a rule honestly and fairly done. It was not a bad
system on the whole, and it was in its incidence probably
as just as local taxation in Great Britain, which I admit is
somewhat faint praise.</p>

<p>As to the administration of justice between man and
man and the security of life and property, there was no
doubt little refinement of law and not always impartiality
in the judges. The majority of civil cases in a society
like Burma, where there are few rich men and no great
landowners, must be trivial, and in Burma disputes were
settled by arbitration or by the village headmen, who could
rarely set at nought the opinion of their fellow-villagers.</p>

<p>In a country which is under-populated and contains vast
areas of land fit for cultivation unoccupied and free to all,
migration is a great check on oppression. Life is simple in
Burma. The climate for the most of the year makes a
roof unnecessary; flitting is easy. Every man is his own
carpenter. He has put together his house of bamboo and
planks cut by his own hands. He knows how to take it
down. He has not to send for contractors or furniture
vans. There are the carts and the plough cattle in his
sheds. He has talked things over with his wife, who is a
capable and sensible woman.</p>

<p>One morning they get up, and instead of going to his
fields or his fishing or whatever it may be, he takes his
tools, and before sunset, his wife helping, the house is down
and, with the simple household goods, is in the cart. The
children find a place in it, or if they are old enough they
run along with the mother. If the local magistrate is so
blind to his own interests as to oppress his people, there is
another wiser man a few score leagues away who is ready
to welcome them. For what is the good of land without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
men to live on it? Is not the King's revenue assessed at
so much to the house? But suppose the worst comes to
the worst and the man in power is a fiend, and neither
property nor life nor honour is safe from him, even then
there is the great forest, in which life, though hard, is a real
pleasure to a man; and, given a good leader, the oppressed
may soon change places with his oppressor.</p>

<p>We are too ready to imagine that life under such a King
as Mindôn or even as Thebaw must be unbearable. We
fancy them armed with all the organization of the Inland
Revenue Department and supported by a force like our
constabulary. Fortunately they were not. No system
of extortion yet devised by the most ruthless and greedy
tyrant is at all comparable in its efficacy to the scientific
methods of a modern revenue officer. The world will
see to what a perfection of completeness the arts of oppression
and squeezing can be carried when the power of
modern European organization is in the hands of a socialist
government.</p>

<p>It need not be supposed, therefore, that under King
Mindôn life in Upper Burma was bad, and it must be
remembered that since 1852 escape to British Burma,
although forbidden, was not impossible.</p>

<p>Under Thebaw things were different. Mindôn was on
the whole well-intentioned, and had kept the power in his
own hands. Thebaw was weak and incompetent, and
the Ministers who had most influence with him were the
worst men. With his barbarities, old-fashioned rather
than unexampled, and perhaps not much worse than the
measures of precaution usually taken in Burma after the
succession of a new king, or with the causes of the war
which led to his deposition, the present narrative is not
concerned. It is desired to give as clear an idea as possible
of the state of Upper Burma when we were called upon to
administer the country.</p>

<p>The rapacity and greed of the Court, where the Queen
Supayalat was the ruling spirit, set the example to the
whole hierarchy of officials. The result was a state of extreme
disorder throughout the whole kingdom. The demands
made on the people for money became excessive and intolerable.
Men left their villages and took to the jungle. Bands
of armed brigands, some of considerable strength under
active leaders, sprang up everywhere. Formed in the first
instance as a protest and defence against extortion, they
soon began to live on the country and to terrorize the
peasantry. After a time, brigands and Ministers, finding
themselves working for a common object, formed an unholy
alliance for loot. The leaders of the bands came to an
understanding with the more powerful officials, who in turn
leant upon them for support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>Under such conditions it was not wonderful that the
sudden seizure of the capital and the summary removal
of the King should have completed the dissolution of society,
already far advanced. The British Government, if it had
decided to annex Upper Burma, might by a more leisurely
occupation, not only with a larger military force, but with
a complete staff of civil administrators, have saved the people
from some years of anarchy and great suffering. But that
is not our way, and under modern political conditions in
England is impossible.</p>

<p>The country was taken and its government destroyed
before we had decided what we should do with it, or considered
the effect on the people.</p>

<p>The King's rule ended on the 29th of November, 1885.
On the 1st of January, 1886, the Viceroy's proclamation
included Upper Burma in Her Majesty's dominions. The
administration of the country was temporarily provided
for by allowing the Hlutdaw, or great Council of State, to
continue in power, discharging all its functions as usual,
but under the guidance of Colonel (afterwards Sir E. B.)
Sladen, who was attached as Political officer to General
Prendergast's staff. All Civil officers, British and Burmese,
were placed under the Hlutdaw's orders, and the King's
Burmese officials throughout the country were instructed
to go on with the regular performance of their duties as
if nothing had occurred. Some arrangement had to be
made, and probably this was the best possible. The best
was bad.</p>

<p>On the 15th of December the Chief Commissioner, Sir
Charles Bernard, arrived at Mandalay from Rangoon.
On his way up the river he had visited Minhla, Pagan and
Myingyan, where Civil officers, supported by small garrisons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
had been placed by General Prendergast. He decided that
these three districts should be removed from the jurisdiction
of the Hlutdaw and controlled directly by himself.
Mandalay town and district were similarly treated. A
British officer was appointed to govern them, under the
immediate orders of Colonel Sladen, who was responsible
to the Chief Commissioner.</p>

<p>All this must have confused the minds of the people and
prevented those who were ready to submit to the British
power from coming forward. Fortunately this period of
hesitation was short. From the 26th of February, 1886,
Upper Burma became a province of British India.</p>

<p>When the Chief Commissioner, who had gone down to
Rangoon with the Viceroy, returned to Mandalay, the
Hlutdaw was finally dissolved and Sir Charles Bernard
took the government into his own hands. A few of the
Burmese Ministers were retained as advisers. At first they
were of some use as knowing the facts and the ways of
the King's administration. Very soon they became superfluous.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that no steps had been taken
towards the construction of an administration during the
first two months of the year. Anticipating the decision
of Her Majesty's Government, Sir Charles Bernard had
applied his signal energy to this work, and before the end of
February the Viceroy had laid his rough proposals before
the Secretary of State. As soon as Upper Burma was
incorporated with British India the scheme of government
already drafted came into force.</p>

<p>The country was mapped out into fourteen districts, corresponding
as closely as possible to the existing provinces
under the King, namely:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">Mandalay&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left">Minbu</td><td align="left">Pagan</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">Myingyan</td><td align="left">Sagaing</td><td align="left">Yamèthin</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>and after a time three more were added: Taungdwingyi,
Meiktila, and the Ruby Mines. The boundaries were
necessarily left vague at first until more accurate knowledge
of the country enabled them to be defined. At first there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
were no maps whatever. The greater part of the country
had not been occupied nor even visited by us.</p>

<p>To each district was appointed an officer of the Burma
Commission under the style of Deputy Commissioner, with
a British police officer to assist him and such armed force of
police as could be assigned to him. His first duty was to
get in touch with the local officials and to induce those
capable and willing to serve us to retain or take office
under our Government.</p>

<p>Having firmly established his authority at headquarters,
he was to work outwards in a widening circle, placing police
posts and introducing settled administration as opportunity
offered. He was, however, to consider it his primary object
to attack and destroy the robber bands and to protect the
loyal villages from their violence. There were few districts
in which the guerilla leaders were not active. Their
vengeance on every Burman who attempted to assist the
British was swift and unmerciful. As it was impossible at
first and for some time to afford adequate protection, villages
which aided and sheltered the enemy were treated with consideration.
The despatch of flying columns moving through
a part of the country and returning quickly to headquarters
was discouraged. There was a tendency in the beginning
of the business to follow this practice, which was mischievous.
If the people were friendly and helped the troops,
they were certain to suffer when the column retired. If
they were hostile, a hasty visit had little effect on them.
They looked on the retirement as a retreat and became
more bitter than before.</p>

<p>Upper Burma was incorporated with British India on the
26th of February. Thereupon the elaborate Statute law of
India, including the Civil and Criminal Codes, came into
force, a body of law which implies the existence of a
hierarchy of educated and trained officials, with police and
gaols and all the machinery of organized administration.
But there were none of these things in Upper Burma, which
was, in fact, an enemy's country, still frankly hostile to
us. This difficulty had been foreseen, and the proper
remedy suggested in Lord Dufferin's minute (dated at
Mandalay on the 17th of February, 1886) in which he
proposed to annex the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The Acts for the Government of India give to the Secretary
of State the power of constituting any province or part
of a province an excepted or scheduled district, and thereupon
the Governor of the province may draw up regulations
for the peace and good government of the district, which,
when approved by the Governor-General in Council, have
the full force of law.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>This machinery is put in force by a resolution of the
Secretary of State in Council, and at the Viceroy's instance
a resolution for this purpose was made, with effect from and
after the 1st of March, 1886. It applied to all Upper Burma
except the Shan States.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Bernard was ready to take advantage of the
powers given to him. Early in March he published an
admirable rough code of instructions, sufficiently elastic
to meet the varying conditions, and at the same time
sufficiently definite to prevent anything like injustice or
oppression. The summary given in Section 10 of the
Upper Burma Administration Report for 1886 shows their
nature.</p>

<p>"By these instructions each district was placed in charge
of a Civil officer, who was invested with the full powers of a
Deputy Commissioner, and in criminal matters with power
to try as a magistrate any case and to pass any sentence.
The Deputy Commissioner was also invested with full
power to revise the proceedings of any subordinate magistrate
or official and to pass any order except an order
enhancing a sentence. In criminal matters the courts
were to be guided as far as possible by the provisions of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, the Penal Code, and the Evidence
Act (<i>i.e.</i>, the Indian Codes). But dacoity or robbery was
made punishable with death, though magistrates were
instructed to pass capital sentences only in very heinous
cases. In order to provide a safeguard against undue
severity in the infliction of punishments, it was ordered
that no capital sentence should be carried out except after
confirmation by the Chief Commissioner. No regular
appeals were allowed from any decision; but it was open
for any one who felt aggrieved by the decision of a subordinate
officer to move the Deputy Commissioner to revise
the order, and for any one who demurred to an order passed
by a Deputy Commissioner to bring the matter to the notice of
the Chief Commissioner.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p>"In revenue matters the customs of the country were as
far as possible to be observed, save that no monopolies
(except that of precious stones) were allowed and no customs
or transport duties were levied. As regards excise administration,
in accordance with the custom of the country the
sale of opium and of intoxicating liquors to Burmans was
prohibited. But a limited number of licences were issued
for the sale of liquors to persons not of Burmese race, and
the Chinese were specially exempted from the restrictions
imposed on the traffic in opium."</p>

<p>Thus in four months after annexation the country had
been parcelled into seventeen districts, each under the
charge of a Deputy Commissioner, who was guided by the
provisional instructions and worked at first directly under
the Chief Commissioner. It was thought (<i>vide</i> Lord
Dufferin's minute of February 17, 1886) that the province
could be worked, in the beginning, without any authority
such as Divisional Commissioners or Sessions Judges interposed
between the Chief Commissioner and the district
officers. "I would adopt, as I have already said," wrote
Lord Dufferin, "the simplest and cheapest system of
administration open to us. There will be in each district
or circle one British Civil officer and one police officer.
The Civil officer will work through the indigenous agency
of the country, Myo-ôks (governors of towns), Thugyis
(headmen of villages) and others, confining his efforts in the
first instance to the restoration of order, the protection of
life and property, and the assessment and collection of the
ordinary revenue.... But most of the unimportant
criminal work and nearly all the civil suits must be disposed
of by the native officials, subject to the check and
control of the district officer."</p>

<p>The area of the province, excluding the Shan States, which
were left to the care of their own chiefs, was nearly one
hundred thousand square miles. It was divided into seventeen
districts. There were no roads in the interior, much
of which was difficult country. The Irrawaddy, it is true,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
formed a splendid line of communication from north to
south. But the river was not connected with the districts
east or west of it by anything better than an ordinary
village cart-track, with numerous streams and rivers, most
of them unbridged. The Eastern districts between the
Sittang and the Irrawaddy were especially inaccessible.
Under such circumstances it was impossible for any man to
discharge the duties imposed on the Chief Commissioner,
even if all his subordinates had been endowed with ripe
wisdom and experience. Only a man of the heroic energy
and devotion of Sir Charles Bernard could have conceived it
possible. Moreover, the Chief Commissioner was to be
responsible for all death sentences, and was to be the final
Court of Revision for the province; while the lower province
also remained in his charge, and although he was
relieved of the routine work of Lower Burma, the responsibility
still rested on him, and was by no means nominal. It
was not business.</p>

<p>The difficulty soon began to be felt. In June a Commissioner
was appointed for the Eastern Division, Mr. St. G.
Tucker, from the Punjab. In August and September three
more commissionerships were constituted, to one of which,
the Northern, was appointed Mr. Burgess (the late Mr.
G. D. Burgess), of the Burma Commission; to the Central
Division, Mr. F. W. Fryer (now Sir Frederick Fryer), from
the Punjab; and Mr. J. D. La Touche (now Sir James
La Touche) from the North-Western Provinces to the
Southern Division. The Chief Commissioner delegated
to them, in their respective divisions, the general control
of the district officers and the revision of their judicial
proceedings, including the duty of confirming sentences
of death.</p>

<p>The administrative divisions of the province, excluding
the Shan States, then stood as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>This organization enabled the Chief Commissioner to
attend to his own work and brought the task of governing
the whole of Burma within the powers of an energetic
man. It enabled him to give sufficient time to the organization
of the revenue and of the police and to the exercise
of that control without which there could be no united
action. The attempt to govern without an authority intervening
between the executive officers in the districts
and the head of the province was due to a desire for
economy, and to the belief that in this way there would
be closer connection and easier communication between
the Chief Commissioner and the executive officers. In
fact, the contrary was the result, and in all such cases
must be.</p>

<p>The framework of a civil administration had now been
formed. It remained to give the district officers such
armed support as would enable them to govern their
charges.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1886 the country generally was far
from being under our control. It had been supposed that
our coming was welcome to the people and that "the prospects
of the substitution of a strong and orderly government
for the incompetent and cruel tyranny of their former
ruler" was by the people generally regarded with pleasure.
(See Lord Dufferin's minute of February 17, 1886.) But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
by July it had become evident that a considerable minority
of the population, to say the least, did not want us, and
that until we proved our strength it was idle to expect
active help even from our friends.</p>

<p>The total military force hitherto employed in Upper
Burma had been about fourteen thousand men. There
was not anywhere in the whole country a well-armed or
organized body of the enemy. A few hundred British
troops could have marched from north to south or from
east to west without meeting with very serious opposition
or suffering much loss. Small flying columns could be
moved through the country and might find no enemy, and
might even gather from the demeanour of the people that
they were welcome. When the soldiers passed on, the
power of the British Government went with them, and the
villagers fell back under the rule of the guerilla leaders
and their gangs. At first there may have been some faint
tinge of patriotism in the motives which drove the leaders
and members of these bands to take the field. Very soon
they became mere brigands, living on the villagers and
taking whatever they wanted, including their women.</p>

<p>"These bands are freebooters," wrote Sir George White<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
(to the Quartermaster-General in India, July 17, 1886),
"pillaging wherever they go, but usually reserving the refinement
of their cruelty for those who have taken office
under us or part with us. Flying columns arrive too late
to save the village. The villagers, having cause to recognize
that we are too far off to protect them, lose confidence
in our power and throw in their lot with the insurgents.
They make terms with the leaders and baffle pursuit of
those leaders by roundabout guidance or systematic silence.
In a country itself one vast military obstacle, the seizure
of the leaders of the rebellion, though of paramount importance,
thus becomes a source of greatest difficulty."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p>The experience of the first half of 1886 had brought
home to the Government of India as well as to the military
officers in the field that the resistance was more widespread
and more obstinate than any one had foreseen. Sir
George White considered that "the most effective plan of
establishing our rule, and at the same time protecting and
gaining touch of the villages, is a close occupation of the
disturbed districts by military posts" (<i>ibid.</i>). Under the circumstances,
this was the best course to adopt, provided that
the posts were strong enough to patrol the country and
to crush every attempt at rising. The people might be
held down in this way, but not governed. Something more
was necessary. The difficulties were to be overcome rather
by the vigorous administration of civil government than by
the employment of military detachments scattered over
the country. A sufficient force of armed police at the
disposal of the civil officers was therefore a necessity.</p>

<p>It had been foreseen from the first by Sir Charles
Bernard and the Government of India, although the
strength of the force necessary to achieve success was
much under-estimated. In February, 1886, two military
police levies, each of five hundred and sixty-one men,
were raised from the Indian army. Of these one was sent
to the Chindwin district and one to Mandalay. At the
same time the recruitment of two thousand two hundred
men in Northern India for a military police force was
ordered. These men were untrained and came over in
batches as they were raised. They were trained and disciplined
at Mandalay and other convenient places, and
were distributed to the districts when they were sufficiently
formed. Thus besides the soldiers the Chief Commissioner
had about 3,300 men at his disposal.</p>

<p>As the year went on and the magnitude of the undertaking
began to be understood, the need of a much larger
force was admitted. Two more levies were sanctioned. One
from Northern India was raised without difficulty, and was
posted to the railway line from Toungoo to Mandalay,
which had been tardily sanctioned by the Secretary of State
in November, 1886, and was at once put in hand. The
other, a Gurkha battalion for use in the Northern frontier
subdivision of Mogaung, was more difficult to recruit.
At the end of the year two companies had arrived, and
after being trained at Mandalay had gone on to Bhamo.
By this time forty-six posts were held by the military
police. The hunger for men, however, so far from being
satisfied, continued to grow. After reviewing the position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in November (1886) Sir Charles Bernard decided to ask the
Government of India for sixteen thousand men, including
those already sanctioned, nine thousand to be recruited in
India and seven thousand in Burma.</p>

<p>It was proposed that ultimately half of this force should
be Indians and half local men. They were all to be
engaged for three years, and were to be drilled and disciplined,
and divided into battalions, one for each district.
Each battalion was to contain fixed proportions of Indians
and local men, "under the command of a military officer
for the purpose of training and discipline and under the
orders of the local police officers for ordinary police work."
At this time it was believed that Burmans, Shans, Karens
and Kachins could by training and discipline become a
valuable element in a military police force, and the experiment
was made at Mandalay. This was the beginning of
the Burma military police force, which contributed so pre-eminently
to the subjugation and pacification of the province.
The attempt to raise any part of it locally was, however,
very quickly abandoned, and it was recruited, with the
exception of a few companies of Karens, entirely from
Indians.</p>

<p>But to return to the middle of 1886. Sir George White,
in writing to Army Headquarters, urged the necessity of
reinforcements. The fighting had, it is true, been trivial
and deaths in action or by wounds had amounted to six
officers and fifty-six men only. Disease, however, had been
busy. Exposure and fatigue in a semi-tropical climate,
the want of fresh food in a country which gave little but
rice and salt fish, was gradually reducing the strength and
numbers of the force. One officer and two hundred and
sixty-nine men had died of disease and thirty-nine officers
and nine hundred and twenty men had been invalided
between November, 1885, and July, 1886.</p>

<p>There were few large bodies of the enemy in the field&mdash;few
at any rate who would wait to meet an attack. It
was only by a close occupation of the disturbed districts by
military posts that progress could be made. The Major-General
Commanding did not shrink from this measure,
although it used up his army. Fourteen thousand men
looks on paper a formidable force, but more men, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
mounted infantry, and especially more cavalry were
necessary.</p>

<p>It had been a tradition at Army Headquarters, handed
down probably from the first and second Burmese Wars,
that cavalry was useless in Burma. The experience of
1885-6 proved it to be the most effective arm. It was
essential to catch the "Bos," or captains of the guerilla
bands, who gave life and spirit to the whole movement.
Short compact men, nearly always well mounted, with a
modern jockey seat, they were the first as a rule to run
away. The mounted infantry man, British or Indian, a
stone or two heavier, and weighted with rifle, ammunition,
and accoutrements, on an underbred twelve-hand pony, had
no chance of riding down a "Bo." But the trooper
inspired the enemy with terror.</p>

<p>"In a land where only ponies are bred the cavalry
horses seem monsters to the people, and the long reach
and short shrift of the lance paralyse them with fear,"
wrote Sir George White, and asked that as soon as the
rains had ceased "three more regiments of cavalry, complete
in establishments," should be added to the Upper Burma
Field Force.</p>

<p>The proposal was accepted by the Commander-in-Chief
in India, Sir Frederick Roberts, and approved by the
Government of India. It may be said here once for all
that the Government of India throughout the whole of this
business were ready to give the local authorities, civil and
military, everything that was found necessary for the
speedy completion of the work in hand, the difficulties of
which they appreciated, as far as any one not on the spot
could.</p>

<p>"It is proposed," they wrote to Lord Cross (August 13,
1886), "to reinforce the Upper Burma Field Force by
three regiments of native cavalry and to relieve all or
nearly all the corps and batteries which were despatched
to Burma in October last. The troops to be relieved will
be kept four or five months longer, so that, including those
sent in relief, the force will be very considerable and should
suffice to complete rapidly and finally the pacification and
settlement of the whole country."</p>

<p>In consequence of the increased strength of the field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
force the Government of India directed Lieutenant-General
Sir Herbert Macpherson, Commander-in-Chief of the
Madras Army, to transfer his headquarters to Burma and
remain there until the conclusion of the operations.
Unfortunately, Sir Herbert died shortly after reaching
Burma. The Commander-in-Chief in India, Sir Frederick
Roberts, then took charge of the business and landed in
Rangoon in November.</p>

<p>It was evident that Sir George White had not exaggerated
the difficulties of the work. After taking stock of
the position, Roberts asked for five more regiments to be
sent from India. During the cold or, as it should be called
in Burma, the dry season following, much was done to gain
control of the country, under the personal supervision of
the Commander-in-Chief. Especially in the Eastern Division,
where large bands of men under various pretenders
had been most troublesome, the stern energy of General
Lockhart produced a rapid and wholesome change. When
Sir Frederick returned to India in February, 1887, the
subjugation of Upper Burma had been accomplished and
the way was cleared for the civil administration. But four
years of constant patient work were needed before the
country was pacified and the peasant who wished to live
a life of honest industry could accomplish his desire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

THE CHIEF COMMISSIONERSHIP OF BURMA</h2>


<p>My first acquaintance with Burma was made in the early
part of 1883. I was then a member of the Legislative
Council of India. Mr. Charles Bernard, who was Chief
Commissioner of British Burma, had asked for a year's leave,
and Lord Ripon selected me to take his place. During that
year, 1883-4, I went over Lower Burma&mdash;British Burma as it
was then called&mdash;and learnt the methods of the administration
and became acquainted with the officers in the
commission and the nature of the country and its people.</p>

<p>There was at that time very little communication
between the Court of Ava and the Chief Commissioner,
who represented the Governor-General in Council. The
embassy which the King had sent to Simla with the
ostensible purpose of making a new treaty had been
suddenly recalled, notwithstanding, and perhaps in some
degree because of, the very honourable and hospitable
manner in which Lord Ripon had received it. The King
was already negotiating a treaty with France, and in 1883,
before the mission despatched for this purpose to Europe
had left Mandalay, it was believed to have been drafted.
But when I surrendered the office to Sir Charles Bernard
on his return from leave in February, 1884, there was no
thought of war in the near future.</p>

<p>From Rangoon I was transferred to Nagpur, to the post
of Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces. Towards
the end of 1885, fever drove me to England on sick leave
just as the relations with the King of Burma were broken
off and war had become unavoidable. Returning from
leave in November, 1886, I found awaiting me at Suez
orders posting me to the Public Service Commission,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of which the late Sir Charles Aitchison was president.
At Bombay I found instructions to proceed at once to
Hyderabad in the Deccan, as the Viceroy (Lord Dufferin)
desired to see me. At Hyderabad I waited on Lord
Dufferin. He told me that Bernard might have to leave,
and he wished to know if I would accept the appointment
of Chief Commissioner of Burma if he decided to offer it to
me. He added that it was in his opinion the post in all India
most to be coveted, and that if he was not Viceroy he
would choose Burma: an unnecessary stimulus, as ever
since leaving that province in 1884 my ambition had been
to succeed Bernard. I told the Viceroy that I would go
to Burma if it were offered to me.</p>

<p>I was with the Public Service Commission at Lahore,
Allahabad, and Jubulpore, and back to Bombay, before
I heard anything more about Burma. At the end of
January, 1887, we were leaving the Parel Station, Bombay,
for Madras, where the next sitting of the Commission was
to be, when the train was stopped just as it began to
move, and the station-master ran up with a clear-the-line
message for me from the Viceroy, desiring me to wait
further orders at Bombay. I left the train gladly, as I
knew that it meant that I was to go to Burma, and I was
delighted to be relieved from the work of the Commission,
which was distasteful to me, especially as it appeared from
the character of the evidence brought forward, a matter left
entirely to the local Government in each province, not
likely to lead to beneficial results. On the 3rd of February
a telegram dated the 2nd came from the Viceroy, offering
me the Chief Commissionership as Bernard's health had
broken down, and desiring me to come to Calcutta to consult
with the Government.</p>

<p>As soon as I could arrange my affairs I went to Calcutta.
The Viceroy received me on the 14th of February. He took
me out to the lawn at the side where the great house throws
a pleasant shade in the afternoon. There we sat, and Lord
Dufferin explained to me how matters stood in Burma, and
gave me his instructions on many points and on the general
principles which he wished to guide the administration.</p>

<p>The organization of the military police and the material
of which the force was to be constituted was one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the chief matters he spoke about. He attached much
importance to the enlistment of Burmans, Shans, and
Karens, so that the unhealthy posts might be held by
acclimatized natives. British officers would have to be
posted to command them, and they must be relieved at
short intervals. He showed me letters which had passed
between him and Bernard about the military police force, to
which, as an instrument in the pacification of the province,
he attached the first importance. He spoke of the strength
of the Commission, and told me to consider it carefully and
ask for more men if I thought them necessary. Generally
he considered that true economy dictated the expenditure of
as much money as was necessary to fit out the new province
with offices, roads, buildings, and river steamers, and it
was folly, he said, not to give it. Barracks and shelter for
troops and police should be vigorously pushed on.</p>

<p>The questions of the Shan States and our relations with
China were discussed. As to the Shan States, I represented
the manner in which our relations with the feudatory chiefs
in the Central Provinces were managed and the saving in
cost and responsibility to be gained by leaving them quasi-independent.
Lord Dufferin approved of this policy and
preferred it to annexation, even in the case of the Wuntho
Sawbwa, who had shown an inclination to refuse submission
to our Government.</p>

<p>The Viceroy spoke at length and with emphasis regarding
our relations with China, which he looked upon as most
important. We were face to face, he said, with a very
powerful neighbour, who might greatly harass us if she or
even her subordinate officials chose to worry us. Two
officers of the Chinese Consular Service had been sent to
Upper Burma to be at my disposal in dealing with the
Chinese in Burma and in conducting relations with the
Chinese Government. In the matter of the frontiers of
Upper Burma, where they touched China, great care should
be exercised. "Feel your way," he said, putting out his
hand, "and when you come against anything hard, draw
back," advice that was most sound in dealing with the ill-defined
boundaries of a conquered province. We wished
to hold what our predecessors had held or had been entitled
to hold, and we did not desire to leave unoccupied space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
for others to come in. He told me to think carefully
whether there was anything I wanted done and to let him
know before I left. I was to see him again.</p>

<p>In a country where one man is as good as another, where
there are no landlords, no hereditary aristocracy and no
tribal chiefs, the Government, especially a foreign Government,
is at a great disadvantage. It is impossible to deal
with each individual. The first question is, who is the
great man of this village: who has influence, who knows
the villagers, their characters and so on? Having found
the man, it becomes possible to enter into relations with
the village and to treat with them as a whole. In Upper
Burma there was a recognized headman in each village
who had duties, and powers corresponding to his duties;
and in many administrative matters, especially in taxation,
the village was dealt with as a whole.</p>

<p>The difficulty in Lower Burma was the absence of such
a local authority or unit. The villagers were not held
together by any obligation to each other or by subordination
to any one on the spot. Each man had his own bit of land
which he held directly from the Government. He lived
where he pleased, and if he put his house in the same
place with other cultivators, it was for the sake of convenience
and protection. The villages were grouped for
revenue purposes by the British administration under
officials who collected the taxes and received a percentage
on the amount. Each of these <i>taik Thugyis</i> (headmen of
circles), as they were designated, had many villages under
him and could not be expected to have local knowledge or
personal influence in all of them. He had no powers outside
his revenue work. It was open to any one to put up
his hut in any village, wherever he could find room. There
was no one to say him nay, even if he was a gambler, an
opium-eater, or a notorious evildoer living by theft and
robbery. There were, it is true, village policemen appointed
by law, who were intended to supply the wants of a local
authority. But no power was given to them: they were
subordinated to the regular civil police and had no status
as revenue officials. Consequently they tended to become
mere village drudges, although by no means useless and frequently
showing both courage and sagacity in police matters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>When I was in Burma in 1883-84 gang-robbery was
prevalent, even in the neighbourhood of Rangoon; so much
so as to demand close attention from the head of the province.
I had observed that in nearly every case where a
large gang of dacoits, to use the Indian term, was dominating
a district or part of a district they were assisted by
sympathisers, who sent them food, supplied them with
information, and made it possible for them to live undetected.
The codes of Indian Criminal Procedure do not
enable a magistrate to touch cases of this sort. If the
people are against the Government&mdash;and in 1887 they were
certainly not minded to help it&mdash;the difficulty of detecting
and convicting such secret abettors is almost insuperable.
At any rate, it was a slow process, and meanwhile violence
and disorder flourished and the peasantry became more and
more enthralled to the brigands.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that nothing would give the civil
magistrate more assistance than the power of summarily
removing persons who, while they themselves appeared to
be living harmless lives without reproach, were enabling
the insurgent or brigand gangs to keep the field.</p>

<p>I explained my views on these matters to the Viceroy.
He promised me his support and desired me to embody my
ideas in a draft Regulation before I left Calcutta. With
the assistance of the Legislative Department the draft was
quickly completed, and on my arrival in Burma it was circulated
to district officers for their opinions. It was
delayed by various formalities and inquiries, and was not
finally made law until October, 1887. Founded so far as
might be on the system indigenous to the country and in
accord with the mind of the people, this law was a great aid
to the administration. Writing in October, 1890, I said:
"I think that most officers will now admit that the policy
of dealing with the people by villages and not by individuals
has been a very powerful instrument for suppressing disorder
and establishing our authority. It would not have
been possible to use this instrument if the village system
had no vitality. If we are to rule the country cheaply and
efficiently and to keep the people from being robbed and
oppressed by the criminal classes, the village system must
be maintained in vigour. It cannot thrive or live unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the post of headman is sought after, or at least willingly
accepted, by respectable persons." I believe the provisions
of the village regulation are still a living force and are
brought into action when occasion arises. But the life of
the system is the headman, his dignity and his position.
This is what the author of "The Soul of a People" wrote
in 1898:&mdash;</p>

<p>"So each village managed its own affairs untroubled by
squire or priest, very little troubled by the State. That
within their little means they did it well no one can doubt.
They taxed themselves without friction, they built their
own monastery schools by voluntary effort, they maintained
a very high, a very simple, code of morals entirely of their
own initiative.</p>

<p>"All this has passed or is passing. The King has gone
to a banishment far across the sea, the Ministers are either
banished or powerless for good or evil. It will never rise
again, this government of the King which was so bad in all
it did and only good in what it left alone. It will never
rise again. The people are now part of the British Empire,
subjects of the Queen. What may be in store for them in
the far future no one can tell; only we may be sure that
the past can return no more. And the local government
is passing away too. It cannot exist with a strong Government
such as ours. For good or for evil, in a few years, it
too, will be gone."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>This is a prophecy which I believe has not yet been
fulfilled, and I hope never will. But to return to the order
of events.</p>

<p>I was detained in Calcutta until the 24th of February.
Time by no means wasted. I had frequent opportunities
of seeing the Members of Council and learning what was
going on in each department. Lord Dufferin allowed me
to discuss matters with him more than once. On the
19th I attended His Excellency in Council and explained
my views, especially regarding the village system. Leaving
Calcutta in the British India steamship <i>Rangoon</i> on the
24th, I landed at Rangoon on Sunday the 27th of March.
Next day I relieved Sir Charles Bernard and took charge
of the Province of Burma.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>In order to enable the Chief Commissioner to give more
time to the affairs of Upper Burma, a Special Commissioner,
Mr. Hodgkinson, had been appointed to take immediate
charge of the older province. I found that the Special
Commissioner was in fact ruler of the Lower Province, and
was so regarded by the public. Nothing which was not
of a very extraordinary nature was referred to the Chief
Commissioner, whose responsibility, however, remained unimpaired.
For example, two or three days after my arrival
the Viceroy telegraphed in cipher to the Chief Commissioner
about some matters in Lower Burma which had
given rise to questions in Parliament, and of which the
responsible Chief Commissioner had no cognizance. No
more competent and trustworthy man than Mr. Hodgkinson
could have been found for the work. Nevertheless the
arrangement did not seem to me quite satisfactory.</p>

<p>There were urgent matters requiring to be settled with
Mr. Hodgkinson, more especially the Budget of the Province
and the organization of the police in Lower Burma, which
needed thorough reform. They had earned the reputation
of being the worst and the most costly in the world, and
during the last eighteen months they had not belied it.
It was necessary to form a body of military police for
Lower Burma of suitable Indians, trained and disciplined.
During the few days I was in Rangoon this and other
urgent matters&mdash;for example, the arrangements with the
Bombay Burma Company about the Upper Burma Forests,
the Ruby Mines, the condition of some of the Lower
Burma districts, the postings of officers, the distribution
of reinforcements of military police just disembarking
from the transports, consultations with the General Commanding
in Lower Burma as to the measures necessary
along and beyond the line of the old frontier within the
limits of his command, all these things and much more
would have given me plenty of work for many days.</p>

<p>I could only dispose of those matters which required
my personal orders and leave the rest to Mr. Hodgkinson.
I could not remain in Rangoon. Sir Charles Bernard
had a powerful memory. The Upper Burma Secretariat
was, as has been said, in Mandalay; when Sir Charles
Bernard was in Rangoon, he relied to a great extent on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
his memory. Letters and telegrams received from Mandalay
were dealt with and returned with his orders, no
copies for reference being kept. As the Rangoon Secretariat
was ignorant of Upper Burma affairs, I found myself
completely in the air. I decided therefore to start as soon
as possible for Mandalay.</p>

<p>I left Rangoon by rail for Prome on the 9th of March.
At Prome a Government steamer, the <i>Sir William Peel</i>,
was waiting for me, and I reached Mandalay on the 14th.
To a man sailing up the river there were few signs of
trouble. The people appeared to be going about their
business as usual, and no doubt along the river bank
and in the neighbourhood of our posts there was little
disorder. But this appearance was deceptive. Just beyond
the old frontier the country from the right bank of the
Irrawaddy up to the Arakan Yoma was in the hands of
insurgents.</p>

<p>On the right bank of the river, forty miles above
Thayetmyo, is the Burman fort and town of Minhla, where
the first opposition was offered to the British expedition.
I found here a small detachment of Indian troops, and in
the town, about half a mile off, a police post. I learnt from
the British officer commanding the detachment and from the
Burman magistrate that for some fifty miles inland, up
to the Chin hills on the west, the villages were deserted and
the headmen had absconded. This is an unhealthy tract,
with much jungle, and broken up into small valleys by the
spurs from the Arakan mountains. The noted leader Bo
Swè made his lair here and had still to be reckoned
with. His story illustrates the difficulties which had to be
overcome.</p>

<p>In November, 1885, after taking Minhla, a district was
formed by Sir Harry Prendergast consisting of a large
tract of country above the British Burma frontier on both
sides of the river to Salin, north of Minbu, on the right bank,
and including Magwè and Yenangyoung on the left. This
district was known at first as Minhla, but afterwards as
Minbu, to which the headquarters were moved. Mr. Robert
Phayre, of the Indian Civil Service and of the British
Burma Commission, was left in charge, supported by a small
force.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/i042.jpg" width="800" height="519" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Thayetmyo&mdash;Mail Steamer leaving.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Phayre, a relative of that distinguished man, Colonel
Sir Arthur Phayre, the first Chief Commissioner of British
Burma, was the right man for the work. He began by
getting into touch with the native officials, and by the 15th
of December all those on the right bank of the river had
accepted service under the new Government. Outposts
were established, and flying columns dispersed any gatherings
of malcontents that were reported. A small body of
troops from Thayetmyo, moving about in the west under
the Arakan hills, acted in support of Minhla. Revenue
began to come in, and at Yenangyoung, the seat of the
earth-oil industry, work was being resumed. Everything
promised well.</p>

<p>There were two men, however, who had not been or
would not be propitiated, Maung Swè and Ôktama. Maung
Swè was hereditary headman or Thugyi of Mindat, a village
near the old frontier. He had for years been a trouble to
the Thayetmyo district of British Burma, harbouring
criminals and assisting dacoit gangs to attack our villages,
if he did not lead them himself. He had been ordered up
to Mandalay by the Burmese Government owing to the
strong remonstrances of the Chief Commissioner.</p>

<p>On the outbreak of war Bo<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Swè was at once sent back
to do his utmost against the invaders. So long as there
was a force moving about in the west of the district he was
unable to do much. When the troops were withdrawn (the
deadly climate under the hills compelled their recall), he
began active operations.</p>

<p>The second man was named Ôktama, one of the most
determined opponents of the British. He had inspired his
followers with some of his spirit, whether fanatical or
patriotic, and harassed the north of the district about and
beyond Minbu. His gang was more than once attacked
and dispersed, but came together again. He and Maung
Swè worked together and between them dominated the
country.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p>In May, 1886, Maung Swè was attacked and driven back
towards the hills. He retired on Ngapè, a strong position
thirty miles west of Minbu and commanding the principal
pass through the mountains into Arakan. Early in June,
1886, Mr. Phayre, with fifty sepoys of a Bengal infantry
regiment and as many military police (Indians), started
from Minbu to attack Maung Swè, who was at a place
called Padein. The enemy were reinforced during the
night by two or three hundred men from Ngapè. The
attack was delivered on the 9th of June, and Phayre,
who was leading, was shot dead. His men fell back,
leaving his body, which was carried off by the Burmans, but
was afterwards recovered and buried at Minbu. Three
days after this two parties of Ôktama's gang who had taken
up positions near Salin were attacked by Captain Dunsford.
His force consisted of twenty rifles of the Liverpool
Regiment and twenty rifles of the 2nd Bengal Infantry.
The Burmans were driven from their ground, but Captain
Dunsford was killed and a few of our men wounded.</p>

<p>Reinforcements were sent across the river from Pagan:
and Major Gordon, of the 2nd Bengal Infantry, with ninety-five
rifles of his own regiment, fifty rifles of the Liverpool
Regiment, and two guns 7-1 R.A., attacked Maung Swè in a
position near Ngapè. The Burmans fought well, but were
forced to retire. Unfortunately the want of mounted men
prevented a pursuit. The enemy carried off their killed and
wounded. Our loss was eight men killed and twenty-six
wounded, including one officer. We then occupied Ngapè
in strength, but in July the deadly climate obliged us to
withdraw.</p>

<p>Maung Swè returned at once to his lair. By the end of
August the whole of the western part of the district was
in the hands of the insurgents, rebels, or patriots, according
to the side from which they are seen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Salin had been besieged by Ôktama. He was
driven off after three days by Captain Atkinson, who brought
up reinforcements to aid the garrison of the post. Captain
Atkinson was killed in the action. Thus in a few weeks
these two leaders had cost us the lives of three officers.</p>

<p>In the course of the operations undertaken under Sir
Frederick Roberts's command in the open season of 1886-87,
this country was well searched by parties of troops with
mounted infantry. Bo Swè's power was broken, and in
March, 1887, he was near the end of his exploits. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
north of the district, the exertions of the troops had made
little impression on Ôktama's influence. The peasantry,
whether through sympathy or fear, were on his side.</p>

<p>I have troubled the reader with this story because it will
help to the understanding of the problem we had before
us in every part of Upper Burma. It will explain how
districts reported at an early date to be "quite peaceful"
or "comparatively settled" were often altogether in the
hands of hostile bands. They were reported quiet because
we could hear no noise. We were outsiders, as indeed we
are, more or less, not only in Burma but in every part of
the Indian Empire&mdash;less perhaps in Burma than elsewhere.</p>

<p>On the way up the river I had the advantage of meeting
Mr. (now Sir James) La Touche, the Commissioner of the
Southern Division, Sir Robert Low,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> commanding at
Myingyan, Brigadier-General Anderson, Captain Eyre, the
Deputy Commissioner of Pagan district (which then
included Pakokku and the Yaw country), and others. At
Mandalay I was able to consult with General Sir George
White, commanding the field force, with His Excellency
Sir Charles Arbuthnot, the Commander-in-Chief of the
Madras Army, and with the civil officers, namely, the
Commissioner of the Northern Division, Mr. Burgess,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
and Mr. (now Sir Frederick) Fryer, the Commissioner of
the Central or Sagaing Division, and their subordinates.
No more capable or helpful men could have been found.
The Commissioner of the Eastern Division was out of reach
for the time. The only way of getting to that country was
by road from Mandalay, which would have taken many
days. I had to wait until I returned to Rangoon and
could go by rail to Toungoo before I made acquaintance
with Mr. Henry St. George Tucker, of the Indian Civil
Service, a Punjab officer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

UPPER BURMA</h2>


<p>I will now give as brief a sketch as may be of the
state of Upper Burma when I arrived in Mandalay in
March, 1887.</p>

<p>Upper Burma, inclusive of the Shan States, contains in
round numbers one hundred and sixty thousand square
miles, of which the Shan States cover sixty thousand miles
and the Chin hills ten thousand. It may be divided, for
the present purpose, into four parts. The first is the great
valley of the Irrawaddy, from the mountain ranges north of
Mogaung to the northern boundary of the Thayetmyo
district; the second is the valley of the Chindwin; the third
is the valley of the Sittang, in which lies the Eastern
Division, down to the boundary of the Toungoo district;
and the fourth is the Shan States. In 1887 the British
administration had not yet touched the Chin hills or the
Kachins in the mountains which divide Burma from China.</p>

<p>Beginning with the Irrawaddy Valley, Mogaung, the
most northerly post of importance, was held by a Burman
Myoôk, or township officer, nominally for us. He collected
the revenue and spent it&mdash;much, no doubt, on his establishment,
for which no regular provision had been made.
South of Mogaung as far as Bhamo the country was quiet,
and no organized gangs were in the field. The Katha
district, which comes next below Bhamo, was disturbed
on the Wuntho border, and was not much under control.</p>

<p>The Wuntho Sawbwa, a Shan chief exercising independent
jurisdiction within his country, had refused our
invitation to come in. A strong force under Brigadier-General
Cox, with Mr. Burgess, the Commissioner of the
Northern Division, had gone to try the methods of peaceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
persuasion. The districts south of Katha, namely Shwèbo
and Ye-u, were controlled by dacoit gangs under active
leaders.</p>

<p>On the left bank of the river the Shan States of Mohlaing
and Möngmit were disturbed by the raids of Hkam
Leng (<i>vide</i> Chapter XX.). The Ruby Mines district, with
its capital, Mogok, was held in force and had remained
submissive since its occupation.</p>

<p>South of the ruby mines lies the district of Mandalay,
shut in on the north and east by the Shan hills. There
was a British force of some thousand men of all arms in
Mandalay itself, with several outlying detachments and a
strong party in the hills at Pyinulwin,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> forty miles on the
road to Hsipaw. In spite of this force the district was
dominated by three or four leaders, who had large followings
and acted in concert. They had divided the country
between them into definite jurisdictions, which they mutually
respected. They collected revenue from the villagers. Disobedience
or any attempt to help the British Government
met with swift and severe punishment. They professed to
be acting under the authority of the Myingun Prince, who
was at the time a refugee in Pondicherry, and they were
encouraged and helped to combine by a relative of the
Prince, known as the Bayingan or Viceroy, who went from
one to the other and supplied them with information. The
district of Ava, south of Mandalay, was in a similar state.
The valleys of the Samôn and Panlaung gave good shelter
to the dacoits. Unfortunately several district boundaries
and divisions of military commands met in this country,
and on that account action was not so prompt as it ought
to have been.</p>

<p>Following the river below Ava, the Myingyan and Pagan
districts extended to both sides of the river, an inconvenient
arrangement inherited from the Burmese Government. The
headquarters of these districts, both on the left bank, were
held by garrisons of some size, and within striking range
the country was controlled.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p>About forty miles from Pagan town, and as many from
the river, is the isolated hill or mountain of Popa. It rises
to a height of four thousand five hundred feet, a gigantic
cone throwing out numerous spurs. It is wooded thickly
almost to the top, and extending for a long distance round
it is a tangle of scrub jungle and ravines, an ideal hunting-ground
for robbers and the home of cattle-thieves.</p>

<p>South of this was the Taungdwingyi district, extending
down to the old border. It was in the hands of a leader
named Min Yaung, who was well provided with ponies, and
even elephants. The northern spurs of the Pegu Yoma
divide this district from the Sittang Valley, and are densely
wooded, offering a harbour of refuge to criminals. To this,
among other causes, it was due that this district gave more
trouble than any other in Upper Burma. It was at that
time separated from the river by the Magwè township,
which belonged to the Minbu district, and enjoyed comparative
peace, owing mainly to the influence of the
Burman governor, who had taken service under us and
for a time was loyal.</p>

<p>These parts of the Myingyan and Pagan districts, which
were on the right bank of the Irrawaddy, were not really
under our control or administered by us. The wild tract
on the Yaw (<i>vide</i> Chapter XXI., p. 295), which was much
left to itself in Burmese times, had not been visited, and
was overrun by dacoits.</p>

<p>Southward, still on the right bank, came the Minbu district,
where Ôktama and Bo Swè were still powerful, the
former in full force.</p>

<p>The difficulties of country and climate which our men
had to face in this district were very great. The west of
the Minbu district lies up against the range of mountains
known as the Arakan Yoma, which run parallel to the sea
and shut off the Irrawaddy Valley from the Bay of Bengal.
The country below the Yoma is what is known in India as
Terai, a waterlogged region reeking with malaria, deadly
to those not acclimatized. Many a good soldier, British
and Indian, found his grave in the posts occupied in this
district, Taingda, Myothit, Ngapè, and Sidoktaya. The
dacoit leaders knew the advantage of being able to live
where our men could not. Soldiers like Captain Golightly
(Colonel R. E. Golightly, D.S.O., late of the 60th Rifles)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and his mounted infantry would have made short work of
them under less adverse conditions.</p>

<p>Passing to the Chindwin, which joins the Irrawaddy at
Pakokku, twenty-five miles above Myingyan, the Upper
Chindwin<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> was fairly quiet. The two local potentates, the
Sawbwa of Hsawnghsup and the Sawbwa of Kalè, were not
of much importance. The former had made his submission;
the latter was holding aloof, but had shown his goodwill
by arresting and delivering to the Deputy Commissioner
a pretender who had attacked a British post and was gathering
to his banner various leaders. Lower down, the country
round Mingin, where Mr. Gleeson, Assistant Commissioner,
was murdered in 1886, was much disturbed. In the Lower
Chindwin there was trouble in Pagyi and Pakangyi. The
former country, which is covered with forests and very
unhealthy, had been placed under the management of Burmans
of local influence&mdash;a plan which answered for a time.
The Kani township, which adjoins Mingin, had been
governed from the first by the Burmese Wun well and
loyally. He was murdered on that account by a dacoit
leader. His younger brother was appointed in his room
and followed in his steps. On the left bank the country
was not openly disturbed. The river trade was busy, but
boats were obliged to take a guard or to be convoyed by
a steam-launch.</p>

<p>At this time the cause of order seemed nearer victory
in the Eastern Division than elsewhere. The Sittang Valley
includes the Kyauksè district, which at first was placed
under the Commissioner of the Central Division, but was
allied in dacoit politics to Meiktila. Myat Hmon, Maung
Gyi, and Maung Lat, names well known to soldiers in
1885-6, hunted this country, making the Hmawwaing
jungles their rallying-ground. When hard-pressed they
took refuge in the hills of Baw and Lawksawk, coming
back when the troops retired. In the three districts of
Meiktila, Yamèthin, and Pyinmana, which then formed the
Eastern Division under Mr. H. St. George Tucker, General
Sir William Lockhart had given them no rest day or night.
Nevertheless, in March, 1887, large bands were still active.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p>The Shan States were in a very troubled state, but a
good beginning had been made, and Mr. Hildebrand had
nearly succeeded in breaking up the Limbin Confederacy
(<i>vide</i> Chapter XV.). But throughout the plateau dacoities
were rife and petty wars were raging. Wide tracts were
laid waste, and the peasantry, deserting their fields, had
joined in the fights or gone across the Salween. Great
scarcity, perhaps in some cases actual famine, resulted, not
from failure of rain, but from strife and anarchy. And this
reacted on Burma proper, for some of the Shan States on
the border gave the dacoits encouragement and shelter.</p>

<p>The whole of Upper Burma at this time was in military
occupation. There were one hundred and forty-one posts
held by troops, and yet in wide stretches of country, in the
greater part of the Chindwin Valley, in the Mogaung
country and elsewhere, there was not a soldier. The tide,
however, was on the turn. The officers in command of
parties and posts were beginning to know the country and
the game, while the dacoits and their leaders were losing
heart. The soldiers had in fact completed their task,
and they had done it well. What remained to be done was
work for the civil administrator.</p>

<p>The first and essential step was to enable the civil officers
to get a firm grip of their districts. For this purpose a
civil police force, recruited from the natives of the country,
was necessary. Without it, detection and intelligence
were impossible. Commissioners and generals were alike
unanimous on this point.</p>

<p>The next thing was to provide an armed force at the
disposal of the district officer, so that he should be able
to get an escort immediately&mdash;for there was no district
where an Englishman could yet travel safely without an
armed escort&mdash;and should be able also to quell risings and
disperse ordinary bands of insurgents or brigands without
having to ask assistance from the army. The military
police had been designed and raised for these purposes, and
the men were being distributed as fast as they arrived
from India.</p>

<p>The relations of the district officers to the commandants
of military police and of the latter to the civil
police officers, and the duties and spheres of each, had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
be defined. I had drafted regulations for these purposes,
and was waiting for the appointment of an Inspector-General
to carry them out. It had been decided before I
left Calcutta that a soldier should be selected for this post.
The military police force was in fact an army of occupation
sixteen thousand strong. Many of them were old soldiers
who had volunteered from the Indian regiments, the rest
were recruited mainly from the fighting races of Northern
India. And they were commanded by young officers, some
of whom had come with somewhat exalted ideas of their
independence. It was imperative, therefore, to get an able
soldier who could look at matters from all points of view,
and who could manage men as well as command them.
For it required a delicate touch to avoid friction between
the military and civil members of the district staff. Some
of the civil officers were young, some were quite without
experience, and some were inferior to the military commandants
in force and ability.</p>

<p>In April, 1887, Colonel E. Stedman, commanding the
3rd Gurkhas, who had accompanied Mr. Hildebrand to the
Shan States, was appointed to be Inspector-General of
Police in Upper Burma, with the military rank of Brigadier-General.
Among the many able officers of the Indian
Army it would have been hard to find another man equally
adapted to the work. I had reason to be grateful to
General Stedman (now Sir Edward Stedman, G.C.B.,
K.C.I.E.) and to the Commander-in-Chief, Lord Roberts
(then Sir Frederick), who selected him.</p>

<p>On the 21st of March, 1887, I wrote to Lord Dufferin
regarding the relations of the district and police officers
as follows: "The relations between Deputy Commissioners,
District Superintendents (Civil Police) and Commandants
(Military Police) are ill-defined and work badly,
unless all are really good fellows. I have decided to keep
the Commandant to his military work, and the District
Superintendent of Police to the real civil police duty&mdash;intelligence,
detection, and investigation. The Deputy
Commissioner has by law supreme control and must
exercise it.... The Deputy Commissioners have no hold
on their districts, and through the absence of a civil police
they get no intelligence and no touch with the people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Hence our military parties sometimes go wandering about
blindly, unable to get any information. There must be
a completely separate trained body of Burman Civil Police,
trained not to arms but to their police duties.... I
have got orders under issue about the location of posts and
everything connected with them and the constitution of
the police in them. We must have some Burmans and
some Civil Police Burmans in every police post, and I
think in every military post also."</p>

<p>The details of these matters could not be settled until
General Stedman came to take up the work. Meanwhile
I must return to affairs at Mandalay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

MANDALAY</h2>


<p>Soon after my arrival in Mandalay I made the Thathanabaing's
acquaintance. He is the head of the Buddhist
monks, the religious order which in Bishop Bigandet's
words is "The greatest in its extent and diffusion, the
most extraordinary and perfect in its fabric and constituent
parts, and the wisest in its rules and prescriptions that
has ever existed either in ancient or modern times outside
the pale of Christianity."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The Thathanabaing is the
head of this order for purposes of discipline and for settling
doctrinal disputes. His title means that he has power
over all religious matters. It is misleading to speak of
him as an archbishop or to apply any of the titles of the
Christian Church to the Buddhist monks, who are not
priests in any sense, but "are the strict followers of Buddha,
who, like him, have renounced the world to devote themselves
to the twofold object of mastering their passions
and acquiring the true wisdom which alone can lead to
the deliverance."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> "The regulations they are subject to
and the object they have in view in entering the religious
profession debar them from concerning themselves in affairs
that are foreign to their calling."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The great mass of the Pongyis, or monks, in Upper
Burma, who may have numbered in 1887 twenty or thirty
thousand persons, obeyed the rules of their order and took
no part in the troubles that followed the annexation. In
the King's time the Thathanabaing neither personally nor
as representative of the order interfered in affairs of State.
He might have, as a work of mercy, pleaded for the remission
of a sentence, but it is doubtful whether he went
beyond that, or whether he had any political influence in
our sense of the word. As a "religious" he would have,
and was bound to have, no concern with mundane affairs.
Could he bring any influence to bear on the people at
large to induce them to submit peacefully to our rule?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"When we speak," writes Bishop Bigandet,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> "of the
great influence possessed by the religious order of Buddhist
monks we do not intend to speak of political influence.
It does not appear that in Burma they have ever aimed
at any share in the management or direction of the affairs
of the country. Since the accession of the house of
Alomphra to the throne, that is to say, during a period
of above a hundred years, the history of Burma has been
tolerably well known. We do not recollect having ever
met with one instance when the Pongyis, as a body, have
interfered in the affairs of State. But in a religious point
of view," continues Bishop Bigandet, "their influence
is a mighty one." And undoubtedly if they were an
energetic, ambitious, and intellectual body, instead of a
thoroughly lazy and densely ignorant set of men, they
might easily direct this influence to worldly purposes, and
they might have excited the people to resist the British.</p>

<p>One of my first acts at Mandalay was to issue orders
for the repair of monasteries occupied by our men and
for making compensation in some form to the monks, and
at least twice afterwards I reiterated and enlarged these
orders. No doubt this matter of the monasteries was a
grievance. But, as often happens, it was made more of
by busybodies and correspondents interested in defaming
the administration than by the sufferers. It was an unfortunate
necessity of war. The only remedy was to build
barracks and reduce the garrison, both of which were
done with all the speed possible. It is worth noting that
the Thathanabaing did not make any complaint to me
on this head. In his conversations with me he dwelt
mainly on the sufferings caused to the monks by the
removal of the inhabitants from the walled city, which
was being converted into a cantonment. The monks
living in the cluster of great <i>Kyaungs</i> (monasteries), of
which the Incomparable was the centre, depended on the
faithful in the city for their food. I reminded him of the
removal of the people by their own monarchs, first from
Ava to Amarapura and then from Amarapura to Mandalay.
He replied that the King removed the <i>kyaungs</i> with
the people, and put them up on the new sites at the
public cost, and also compelled his Ministers to build new
monasteries. He was amused by my suggesting that the
Commissioner and the secretary who accompanied me should
be ordered to erect some monasteries on the sites to
which the people were being moved. He saw the humour
of it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/i056.jpg" width="800" height="491" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Ponghi's funeral procession.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>I found the Thathanabaing in my intercourse with him
always courteous and good-humoured; and in his bearing
there was neither arrogance nor ill-will. Of the Pongyis
generally in Upper Burma I saw something, as in riding
about the districts (there were no motors or tents for Chief
Commissioners in those days) we had generally to ask the
Pongyis to give us shelter; and their manner was courteous
and hospitable. Not a few, I thought, felt and deplored
the misery which the disturbances caused, and would have
been glad to work for peace. It must be remembered that
from the experience of our rule in Lower Burma they knew
the attitude of the British Government towards their religion.
They had no reason to fear oppression or persecution.
They knew at the same time that in losing a Buddhist King
their position and influence must be lowered. They could
hardly be asked to rejoice with us.</p>

<p>In common with others who know Burma better, I doubt
if the religious orders as a body had much influence on
the course of events, or took an active part in the resistance
to us. When a monk became a noted leader, it was a
patriot who had been a monk and not a monk who had
become a patriot. At the same time some of the most
serious and deepest-laid plots were hatched in monasteries
or initiated by Pongyis.</p>

<p>I may give some instances of the conduct and feelings of
Pongyis.</p>

<p>In August, 1887, a pretender calling himself the Pakan
Prince joined a conspiracy to get up a rebellion in Mandalay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
The police detected the movement and the prince was
arrested. The prince told all that he knew. The originator
of the scheme was a Sadaw or Abbot living in one of the
Thathanabaing's monasteries. He made his escape. I sent
for the Thathanabaing and he consented readily at my
request to cite the Sadaw to appear before him and to proclaim
him as a man with whom Pongyis should not associate.
Whether he was sincere or not, I cannot say. But he issued
the injunction and I took care it was widely published.
Another case shows how the people as well as the Pongyis
were coming to regard us. The town of Tabayin in the Ye-u
(now Shwèbo) district was burnt by insurgents soon after our
occupation of Mandalay. It was rebuilt in 1887 owing to the
exertions of certain Pongyis formerly attached to the place.
In order to ensure protection for the new town the Pongyis
induced the people to build a barrack at their own expense
for the police. Similarly, in July, 1887, when I was at
Ngathaingyaung in the Bassein district of Lower Burma
the people were glad to have a detachment of Bengal Infantry
(7th Regiment) in one of the monasteries. They welcomed
them. One of the monks had learned Hindustani
from the men; and the Abbot, or head Pongyi, told me he
would gladly give up his own monastery if it was wanted for
the soldiers.</p>

<p>Another matter which occupied my attention in Mandalay
at this time was our position towards the Chinese in Upper
Burma. They are most numerous in the Northern Division
and congregate in Bhamo and Mandalay. They numbered
according to the census of 1901 about ten thousand, and may
have been less in 1887. Owing to their energy in trade and
their wealth they formed a not insignificant body, and like
most bodies they had their grievances.</p>

<p>It was arranged to hold a meeting in order to let them
state their complaints. All the prominent Chinese in
Mandalay attended the meeting, and Mr. Warry was present
to interpret for me. They had minor grievances about the
collection of the jade duties and the farm of the india-rubber
tax in the Mogaung subdivisions. These things were easily
arranged. The chief subject of complaint, however, was the
difficulty in procuring and trading in opium, a matter not
to be easily settled. The regulations issued by the Chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Commissioner in March, 1886, practically stopped the
traffic. The words were these:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No shops whatever will be licensed for the sale of
opium, inasmuch as all respectable classes of Burmans
are against legalizing the consumption of opium in the new
province. Any one found selling opium to persons other
than Chinese, or transporting opium in quantities above
three tolahs, or keeping a saloon for consuming opium, will
be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding Rs. 500 or
to three months' imprisonment, or to both. As traffic
in opium was absolutely prohibited under the Burmese
Government, there will be no hardship in thus proscribing
opium dealings."</p>

<p>The Chinese, however, considered it the greatest hardship.
The small quantity, little more than one ounce troy weight,
which might be lawfully transported, practically stopped
dealings in the drug. This provision may not seem to go
beyond the regulations of the Burmese Government. But
there was all the difference between a rule meant to be
enforced and one that could be easily evaded or was not
intended to be made effective. No doubt the prohibition
by the King of the use of opium by Burmans was real, and
was backed by religious precept and influence; but the
restrictions on the Chinese were laxly administered and
were not too inconvenient to them.</p>

<p>If the Burmese alone had been concerned, opium might
have been prohibited altogether, and the prohibition might
have been made effectual, for it would have been backed
by a very strong religious sanction. But the Chinamen
had to be considered. It was contrary to our interests and
wishes, especially at that time, in Upper Burma to make
things unpleasant for them. They are at all times a useful
and enterprising element in the population, although the
ingenuity of the least reputable amongst them in exploiting
the Burmans and leading them to gamble and to smoke
opium requires to be firmly checked.</p>

<p>A second objection to prohibition, and even greater than
the hardship and annoyance it would cause to the Chinese,
was the great difficulty&mdash;almost impossibility, it may be
said&mdash;of enforcing it.</p>

<p>Opium is perhaps as easy, and in Burma as profitable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to smuggle as any article in the world. The Chinese are
born smugglers. The poppy is largely cultivated in
Yunnan and in the hilly country on the Salween. To
prevent smuggling of opium overland into Burma would
require a very large expenditure and a numerous establishment.
The thousand miles of coast would be equally
difficult to watch. If the growth of the poppy is prevented
in China and India it may perhaps become practicable
to stop opium from entering Burma. It was futile at that
time and under those circumstances to attempt absolute
prohibition.</p>

<p>The Indian Excise and Opium Acts were extended to
Upper Burma in the latter half of 1888. The restrictions
on the sale to Burmans of opium and intoxicants were
maintained&mdash;and neither excise licence nor opium-shop
was allowed in any place where the non-Burman population
was not considerable. Yunnan opium, which had hitherto
come in free, was subjected to a duty. The result was a
great increase in the price of opium in Upper Burma and
at the same time energetic smuggling; while it was
believed, that so far as the restrictions against the sale
of liquor or opium to Burmans were effectual, their efficacy
was due, as in the King's time, more to the strength of
the Buddhist religion than to the power of the British
Government and the honesty of its magistrates. No
further change was introduced while I was in Burma.</p>

<p>An excitement, however, arose in England, and the
societies who, belonging to one of the most intemperate
races in the world, make it their vocation to preach temperance
to the most abstemious and sober of nations, drove
the Government of India to experiment on Burma. Since
1893 one device after another has been tried to prevent
Burmans from getting opium. The results appear to have
been that contraband opium has been driven to some extent
from the market; that the consumption of Government
opium which has paid duty has doubled; that hundreds
of people are punished yearly, not a few on false charges,
for offences against the Opium Act, many of them by
imprisonment; that the use of cocaine and other drugs
worse than opium has been substituted for it, and in spite
of the police is growing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The following passage from a very excellent and accurate
handbook of Burma by Sir J. George Scott, K.C.I.E.
(Alexander Moring, Ltd., 1906) is worth quoting as the
opinion of a man who knows the country well:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In Kokang and the Wa States the out-turn (of opium)
runs to tons. West of the Salween, Loimaw is the only
place where opium is systematically grown for profit. The
cultivators are all Chinamen, and the amount produced
in the season reaches about four thousand pounds. The
price ranges from twelve to fifteen rupees for three and
a half pounds. No doubt a very great deal is smuggled
into Burma by opium-roads&mdash;tracks only passable by
coolies, and not known to many. It is to be noted that
there are no victims to opium in the opium-producing
districts, any more than there are in Ssu-ch'uan, where
the people are the wealthiest in China and half the crops
are poppy. It is only in places where opium is prohibitive
in price that there are victims to opium. If a man is
accustomed to take opium, he must have it to soothe his
nerves under excessive fatigue; if he lives in a malarious
district, it is necessary to kill the bacteria. When such
a man is poor and comes to a place where opium duty
is high, he has to starve himself to get the anodyne for
his muscles, quivering under the weight of loads which
no white man could carry, or to soothe the racking fever
in his bones. He dies of want and opium is denounced.
Where opium is cheap, the people are healthy and stalwart
and the women are fruitful. East of the Salween the
universal opinion of opium is that of the Turk, who stamps
on his opium lozenges <i>Mash Alla'h</i>, 'the gift of God.'
Some of the Wa eat as well as smoke opium; but, so
far as is known, regular opium-eating is rare, and none
of the races drink it in the form of an emulsion, like the
<i>Kusumba</i> of the Rajputs. West of the Salween, the
European cant about opium has penetrated. A Shan
either tells deliberate lies or says he only smokes when
he has fever. The Rumai is pious and hypocritical, and
says his opium is intended for his ponies or for cases
of malarial fever. There are, of course, cases of excess,
but the opium victim is never the hideous spectacle of
the man sodden with alcohol or the repulsive bestiality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
that the man becomes who takes food to excess"
(pp. 268-69).</p>

<p>The only laws that will preserve the Burmans from the
evils of opium and alcohol and other drugs are the teachings
of Buddha. So long as they preserve their vigour
and command the Burmans' belief, there is not much
fear. The danger is that Buddhism will be undermined
by Western education and contact with Europe, before it
can be replaced by a better and stronger faith. The
number of young Burmans coming to England is increasing.
Will they return as abstemious and as temperate
as they came? They will not: the danger to the Burman
is probably more from alcohol than from opium, and more
from contact with the West than with China.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>This question, however, had no influence whatever on
the work we were engaged in. I was able to reassure the
Chinese and to make them feel that the Government
desired to treat them with fairness and consideration. The
Chinese in Burma behaved throughout these stormy years
as loyal citizens. There were at first numerous reports of
hostile gatherings on or near the Chinese frontier, especially
in the north of Hsenwi and at Hpunkan, near Bhamo.
They had little foundation in fact. The only case in which
it is certain that an armed body of Chinese entered Burma
was in January, 1889. A strong body of Chinamen, chiefly
deserters from the Chinese army and outlaws, gathered on
the Molè stream north-east of Bhamo. They were promptly
attacked by the police and so severely handled that they
were not heard of again.</p>

<p>Still less influence on the restoration of order had the
Ruby Mines affair, which excited the British public and
enabled parliamentary busybodies to create an absurd
fuss. The whole question of these mines and their administration
might well have waited until we had pacified the
country. Even as a source of revenue they were of no
great moment, and if we had left the native miners alone
we should have saved the heavy expense of maintaining a
strong force up in the hills and making a long and costly
cart-road from the river. Mogok, the headquarters of the
mines, lies nearly six thousand feet above the sea-level, and
is distant sixty miles by road from the river port of
Thabeikkyin, most of it lying through thick jungle, poisoned
with malaria and, in 1887, infested with dacoits.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p>The mines were then worked by the Shans, who live on the
spot and have hereditary rights. A proposal had been made
by Sir Charles Bernard, and supported by the Government of
India, to give a lease of the mines for three years to Messrs.
Gillanders Arbuthnot, of Calcutta, at an annual rent of two
lakhs of rupees, the equivalent then of about £14,000.
This firm had been accustomed to trade in rubies with the
Shans at Mogok. The proposal was judicious, and would
have enabled the Government to learn the value of the
mines before committing themselves for a longer term,
as the firm's books were to be open to inspection.</p>

<p>This proposal, however, did not meet the views of the
gentlemen who had marked down the ruby mines as a field
of speculation. A parliamentary intrigue was got up.
Questions were asked&mdash;jobs were hinted at. The enormous
value of the mines&mdash;the richest ruby mines in the world&mdash;was
talked about, until the British public began to see
rubies and to suspect, I verily believe, Sir Charles Bernard
and all of us, his official heirs and successors, of desiring to
make dishonest fortunes. Some of the speculators went to
Simla to persuade the Government of India that Gillanders
Arbuthnot's offer was inconceivably ridiculous. Then they
came on to Rangoon with letters of introduction, not unaccompanied
by hints and warnings to be careful, to sniff
about the mines and get the ear of the authorities in Burma.
The Secretary of State trembled lest he should be suspected
of favouring somebody; and if I had destroyed Mandalay
or drained the Irrawaddy, I doubt if there would have been
more disturbance than was caused by the grant to one of
the prospectors of a few yards of worthless land at Mogok
on which to erect a hut, and of an ordinary licence to mine.</p>

<p>Eventually an expert was sent out to inspect and value
the mines. The gentleman deputed to this duty was no
doubt a skilled mineralogist, even if he was without previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
experience in ruby mines. It is possible that his report
was worth the cost. It was, I take it, a means of getting out
of a parliamentary difficulty. It served the Secretary of
State for India as an excuse for delay, and gave the appearance
at least of a searching and impartial investigation.</p>

<p>Late in 1889 a concession for seven years was granted to
five lucky promoters; and then the course usual in such
cases was followed. A company was floated in London
under the auspices of a big financier. The success for the
concessionaires was unexampled. The public, especially the
small investors, in an enthusiasm of greed, tumbled over
each other to secure shares. In November, 1889, the company
began to work. Its history since has not been one of
remarkable prosperity either for the Government or the
shareholders. The terms have been revised several times.
The receipts of the Government from the company in
1903-4 were Rs. 2,11,500, or £14,000.</p>

<p>The history of this matter is interesting only as an
example of the futility of interfering with the Government
of India in local matters. To the administration of Burma
it meant more writing, more labour, more anxiety, when
attention was needed elsewhere. When a man's house is
on fire he does not want to spend time in polishing the
handle of his door. I was compelled to keep at Mogok
better men and a stronger force than the district needed.
For some years there was much disturbance in the neighbouring
country. But it was unconnected with the mines.</p>

<p>It is a defect in parliamentary government that so many
members, avoiding the really important matters, fasten
greedily on lesser questions, especially those which promise
a scandal. As Parliament chose to look at this matter as
one of imperial interest, the mines acquired an importance
out of all proportion to their value. I found the ruby
mines was a burning question, and I had to go there without
delay. I left Mandalay on the 29th of March in a steamer
for Kyannyat, which was then the river station for Bernard
Myo and Mogok, with Mr. Herbert White and my private
secretary. We rode the forty miles from the river to
Sagadaung, the halting-place at the foot of the hills, taking
as we went an escort of five mounted men (Gurkhas) from
the military posts on the road, and stopped there for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
night. From Sagadoung a mule-path (twenty miles) took
us to Bernard Myo, where I halted, and next day rode into
Mogok.</p>

<p>The regulations and conditions under which it was proposed
to allow the mines to be worked were explained
to the native mineowners and to the persons present on
behalf of the applicants for the concession, and the way
was cleared for a settlement.</p>

<p>A matter of more importance, although not one in which
Parliament was interested, was the dispute about Möngmit
and Mohlaing (explained in Chapter XX.). The Sawbwa of
Möngmit and his ministers, as well as the claimant, Hkam
Leng, had been summoned to attend me. The latter did
not appear. He was one of the few irreconcilables Upper
Burma produced. The investigation of the case satisfied
me that he had no title to Möngmit, and I ordered him to
be informed that his claim to that State was inadmissible,
but that he would be recognised as chief of Mohlaing if he
appeared and submitted.</p>

<p>After a few days at Mogok I returned to the river, marching
down by the Thabeikkyin road. We were obliged to
go slowly, as it was thought necessary to take an escort of
twenty-five Gurkhas. One Paw Kwe, the headman of a
village on the road, the influential brigand in these parts
and one of the most evil-looking rascals I ever met, accompanied
the Deputy Commissioner, Mr. Carter,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and was in
a measure responsible that no mischief should befall us.
In the hope of keeping him quiet I gave him a subsidy for
carrying the mails. But he preferred unemployment and
took again to the jungle after a time, and, I believe, became
an irreconcilable.</p>

<p>The leisurely march down gave time to take up some
matters of importance that were waiting for me.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<p>In the forefront of pressing questions was the provision
of a sufficient fleet of steam-launches. The delta of the
Irrawaddy, where the population is most dense and most
wealthy, is a country of rivers and creeks, where most
of the transport is by boats. In the rice-harvest season
the waterways are much used by the Burman craft
carrying rice to the mills at Rangoon or Bassein, or
making their way homeward with the money for which
it has been sold.</p>

<p>The waterways needed to be patrolled. The disorders
following the annexation extended to the creeks and rivers,
and river pirates had become more daring and the necessity
of a well-formed service of river police more urgent.
Lower Burma was not well provided in this matter; and
being unable to obtain funds, the administration was driven
to apply local funds intended for roads to the purchase
of launches.</p>

<p>In the Upper Province the want of suitable boats was
even greater. There were some six hundred miles of waterway
to be served. The rivers were the main lines of
communication, and on the banks were placed in most
cases the headquarters of districts, the military stations and
outposts, and most of the larger villages and busier markets.
At first, until I had time to revise administrative boundaries,
several districts included land on both banks. Insurgents
and dacoits had no difficulty in obtaining boats
for the purposes of attacking river craft or waterside
villages, or of escaping from pursuit. Once or twice we
were compelled to put an embargo on the boats to hinder
the enemy from getting across, but it was impossible to
interfere thus with the river life of the province, except
under great necessity and for a very short time.</p>

<p>To meet the demands of the soldiers, the police, and the
district officers, and, before the telegraph service was
complete, to keep up communication between stations and
outposts, many boats were required. It was also necessary
to have the means of moving small bodies of troops up
and down or across the river without delay as the need
might arise.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<p>I had little difficulty in showing the need for a better
fleet. But the Government of India were startled at my
demands. The Director of Indian Marine, Captain John
Hext, R.N. (now Rear-Admiral Sir John Hext, K.C.I.E.),
was sent down to persuade me to reduce the size and cost
of my navy. He was successful, and might perhaps succeed
in persuading the Emperor of Germany to limit his naval
armaments. He had designed an excellent type of river
boat, a very light-draught paddle-wheeler, with simple
machinery and fair speed, with accommodation for half
a company of rifles and a couple of officers. They were
built under his instructions in the Government dockyard at
Kidderpore. Being his own creation, he named them the
X type. In Burma they were called after every type of
robber known to the country. It was agreed that I was
to have nine of these boats and four smaller craft. I had
asked for twenty-three boats, and looking back, I am
surprised at my moderation. At the present time, after
twenty years of peace and freedom from organized crime,
I believe the Burma Government has a fleet four times
as large as that with which I had to be content. But then
I was, as it were, a pioneer.</p>

<p>I was back in Mandalay on the 10th of April. There
were some gleams of light between the clouds. Baw or
Maw, a small Shan State on the Kyauksè border, had been
brought to reason by General East without fighting: the
Kalè Sawbwa on the Chindwin had completed the payment
of his tribute: Hla U, the most noted leader in the Sagaing
district, had been killed by his own men, who were sick
of the life.</p>

<p>On the other side of the account, Sinbyugyun, a post
north of Salin in the Minbu district, held by a military garrison
of fifty men, had been attacked twice and partially
burnt. The news from the Northern Shan States was somewhat
disquieting. A desultory warfare was going on in
Hsenwi between the hereditary chief of the State, who had
allied himself with the pretender, Saw Yan Naing, and San
Ton Hon, the usurper in possession of Northern Hsenwi,
supported by the Sawbwa of Hsipaw. It was reported that
San Ton Hon was being driven back, and it was feared that
the Hsipaw chief, who was our only assured friend in the
Shan States, might suffer a repulse. It seemed at one time
that it might become necessary to send an officer to Hsipaw
with a small force. I was unwilling to take this step. I
wished to leave the Northern Shan States alone until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
next open season, and then to deal with the settlement of
the States as a whole. The rains, moreover, were now near
at hand, and Sir George White disliked moving troops into
the hills if it could be avoided. I held a party of military
police ready, and had obtained the Viceroy's consent
to act, if it should be necessary. Meanwhile arms and
ammunition were sent up to Hsipaw, and the Sawbwa,
who was not more incapable or half-hearted than his
opponents, contrived to hold his own until the next open
season.</p>

<p>The military police were arriving now, and were being
distributed and sent to their various destinations.</p>

<p>I could do little more by remaining in Mandalay. The
most urgent matters in connection with the police were
the definition of their duties and of their relations with the
civil officers, their housing, rationing, and medical treatment.
Until, as I stated before, these matters had been
discussed and settled with the new Inspector-General of
Police, little progress could be made in relieving the soldiers
from occupying the small posts.</p>

<p>General Stedman was expected to arrive in Rangoon
about the middle of May, and it was convenient that he
should meet me there.</p>

<p>Another matter which called me to Rangoon was the
condition of Lower Burma. Shortly before I took charge
the Government of India had called the Chief Commissioner's
attention to the state of the province, "the constant
occurrence of petty dacoities (gang robberies), the apparent
want of concerted and energetic action in dealing with
them which," they wrote, "have attracted the serious
notice of the Governor-General in Council. His Excellency
trusts that the subject may receive your immediate and
active intervention."</p>

<p>The condition of the province was bad from a police point
of view. The people had enjoyed excellent harvests and
good prices. Yet there was a constant recurrence of crime,
and the police quite failed to cope with it. The excitement
of the last year or two had been too much for the younger
Burmans. They could not settle down again, and the
spirit of loot and adventure rather than any real patriotism
led to numerous gang robberies, and sometimes to foolish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
outbreaks, of which men from Upper Burma were sometimes
the instigators.</p>

<p>Even within a short distance of Rangoon an Upper
Burman, related, it was said, to the Minbu leader, Ôktama,
raised the Golden Umbrella and called for followers. Some
hundreds obeyed the call, but at the first sight of the police
they began to disperse. A party of Karens, led by a British
police officer, came up with some of them, killed and
wounded several, captured others, and made an end of
the rising.</p>

<p>The Karens in Lower Burma were loyal and generally
staunch, especially the Christian Karens. The American
Baptist missionaries have done an inestimable service to
the Karen race. They understand thoroughly how to
educate&mdash;in the true sense of the word&mdash;a tribe that has
been despised and trodden down for some generations. The
missionary has made himself not only the pastor but also
the chief of his people, and in those troubled times he
organized them under their catechists, taught them discipline
and obedience, and made them useful and orderly
members of society, industrious, self-respecting, and independent.
The Government of Burma owes a debt to the
American Baptist Mission which should not be forgotten.</p>

<p>On receipt of this letter from the Government of India,
reports from Commissioners and from the head of the
police had been called for. Their answers were now before
me. The Inspector-General of Police in Lower Burma
was the late Mr. Jameson, an officer of ability and long experience.
He frankly admitted that the police administration
had failed in suppressing organized brigandage. "So
far," he wrote, "from the crime of dacoity having been
eradicated by British administration, each year more
dacoities are committed than in the one preceding." He
attributed this failure to defects in the judicial courts,
especially the Court of Revision and Appeal, which
resulted in making punishment very uncertain and sentences
capricious; to the absence of any law establishing a village
organization and responsibility; and to the number of arms
in the hands of the peasantry, who received them for their
self-defence against dacoits, but gave them or lost them to
the robbers. The result was, Mr. Jameson asserted, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
after thirty-five years of British rule the country "was in a
more disturbed state than after the second war."</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the judicial administration in
Lower Burma was defective. The Judicial Commissioner
who presided over the Chief Appellate and Revising Court
for the interior of the province was selected by the Government
of India from the members of the Indian Civil Service
of one of the Indian provinces, and seldom stayed long in
Burma. It is no libel on the distinguished men who have
held this position to say that as a rule they had no knowledge
of the language or customs of the people or of the
conditions of Burma. They came from some quiet province
of India, and were unable at first to appreciate those conditions.
One of them might think the sentences awarded
by the magistrates too severe; his successor might pronounce
them to be too lenient.</p>

<p>There was a tendency to forget that an act&mdash;for example,
shooting a thief or burglar at sight&mdash;which in a quiet and
settled country may be a crime, may be excusable in a state
of society where plunder and murder by armed robbers are
everyday occurrences.</p>

<p>Much mischief may be and was done by well-intentioned
but inept judicial action; neither the police nor the people
knew how far they might go in defending themselves or in
effecting the capture of criminals, and circulars were issued
explaining the law which would have puzzled the Chief
Justice. A Burman peasant before he fired his gun had to
consider whether all the conditions justified him; and a
frontier guard had to pause with his finger on the trigger
while he recalled the words of the last circular on the use
of firearms. The result was that the police and the people
were nervous and demoralized. It was better to let the
dacoit pass or to run away than to run the risk of a trial for
murder.</p>

<p>This may seem exaggeration. On one occasion when
the prisoners in a central gaol mutinied, the armed guard
stood idle, until at last, when the convicts were breaking
out, one of the guards took his courage in both hands and
fired. The riot was checked. I wished to reward the man,
but the superintendent of the gaol reported that he could
not discover who had fired the shot. The warders said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
they did not doubt the Chief Commissioner's power to
reward them, but they knew the Judicial Commissioner
would hang the man who fired the gun.</p>

<p>The freedom with which licences to possess firearms had
been granted in Lower Burma was no doubt responsible for
the facility with which the bad characters could arm themselves.
Every day's experience proved that to arm the
villagers was to arm the dacoits. Burmans are incredibly
careless. Even the Burman constables, who were to some
extent trained and disciplined, constantly allowed their guns
to be taken. A half-hearted measure had been in force in
Lower Burma, which required that a village must have
at least five guns, as it was thought that with that number
they could defend themselves. Like most half-measures,
it was of no use.</p>

<p>The absence of a village organization and of the means
of enforcing village responsibility was no doubt a very great
obstacle in the way of the police, even if the police had
been good. But when everything had been said it came
to this, that the police were bad and police administration
in a hopeless muddle.</p>

<p>The Burmans have, from the first day that British
officers have tried to discipline them, shown a great want
of responsibility and incurable slackness and little sense
of duty. They cannot be trusted to keep watch and ward,
to guard or escort prisoners or treasure, or even to remain
on duty if they are posted as sentries. The discipline of
Frederick the Great might have improved them. But he
would have shot most of his men before he had made
trustworthy soldiers of the few that remained.</p>

<p>Hence it came to pass that Indians were enlisted to
perform the duties which the Burmans seemed unable
to fulfil. A few Indians were posted to every station for
these purposes, and the Burmans were employed mainly
on detection and investigation and reporting. This system
led to still further deterioration of the Burman constable,
who ceased to rely on his own courage or resources.</p>

<p>The Indians, again, were recruited locally. The police
officers who recruited them had no experience of the Indian
races and did not know one caste from another. The most
unfit men were taken. They were not much looked after,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and their officers did not know the Indian languages or
understand their customs.</p>

<p>When the risings took place in Shwègyin and elsewhere
after the annexation, the Burma police showed themselves
to be absolutely untrustworthy. More Indians were enrolled
and the mischief increased. The Burman knew he
had behaved badly and was not trusted, and became more
untrustworthy, while the Indians were not under proper
discipline, scattered about as they were in small parties,
and were in any case quite useless for detective or ordinary
police purposes. The only exception to this condemnation
of the indigenous police that could be made was, I think,
the armed frontier guard in the Thayetmyo district, who
were stationed and housed with their families on the
frontier of British Burma.</p>

<p>It was clear that the working of the police force in
Lower Burma required thorough investigation, and that
its constitution would have to be recast. As necessary
subsidiary measures, the country would have to be
thoroughly disarmed, and above all a village organization
must be created and the joint responsibility of the village
for certain crimes enforced.</p>

<p>A committee was appointed to consider the best method
of reforming the civil police force of Lower Burma. I took
in hand the question of thoroughly disarming the whole
province, and a bill dealing with Lower Burma villages on
the lines of the Upper Burma village regulation was framed.</p>

<p>These matters would take some time. The Indian police,
however, could be improved at once. It was decided to
remove all Indians from the civil police, and to enroll them
in a regiment under a military commandant, similar to one
of the Upper Burma military police battalions in formation
and discipline. Their headquarters were to be at Rangoon,
and the men needed for other districts were to be sent
from Rangoon and treated as detachments of the regiment.
They were to be enrolled for three years under a Military
Police Act, which was passed in 1887. Pending the report
of the Committee and the measures that might be taken
on their advice, it was necessary to act at once in the most
disordered parts of the province. Especially in portions of
the Shwègyin district in Tharawaddy, and in the northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
townships of Thayetmyo the dacoit gangs were strong and
active. The ordinary district staff seemed helpless and
unable to make head against the brigands, to whose
exactions the peasants had become accustomed. They
found it easier to make terms with the criminals than to
help a government that was unable to protect them.</p>

<p>I adopted the plan of selecting a young officer known
for his activity and character, and placing him in charge
of the disturbed tract, giving him a sufficient police force
and magisterial powers, and making him independent of
the Deputy Commissioner of the district, who continued
to conduct the ordinary administration. This special officer
had no other duty than to hunt down and punish the gangs
of outlaws. He was to be always out and always on their
tracks, using every means in his power to make friends
with the villagers and induce them to give him information
and help against the common enemy.</p>

<p>This policy succeeded, and the disturbed districts were
brought into line. The late Mr. Henry Todd Naylor,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> of the
Indian Civil Service, distinguished himself especially in this
work, and won a well-merited decoration from the Viceroy.</p>

<p>I had made up my mind to dispense with the services of
the Special Commissioner for Lower Burma as soon as
possible. The appointment was undoubtedly necessary at
first, when communications were bad, but as the province
settled down the need was less and the saving of labour to
me very little. The responsibility remained with me. I
was bound to know everything that went on, and in such
matters as the condition of the province the Government
of India expected me to intervene personally.</p>

<p>The work and exposure since the annexation were beginning
to tell on the members of the Commission, especially
on those who had sustained the heaviest burdens of responsibility
and had been most exposed to the climate, and I was
hard pressed for men to fill the places of those who wanted
leave.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> An accident happening to the Commissioner of
Tennasserim, I decided to send Mr. Hodgkinson there and
to take the Lower Burma work into my own hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>An increase to the Secretariat had been sanctioned in
April, 1887. This enabled me to save a man by appointing
Mr. Smeaton (the late Donald Mackenzie Smeaton,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
C.S.I., M.P.), to the newly created post of Chief Secretary.
He had served for some years in Burma, with distinction,
under Sir Charles Aitchison and Sir Charles Bernard.</p>

<p>In a short time the Secretariats were united in Rangoon
and the work distributed into the ordinary departments of
Indian administration without reference to territorial division.</p>

<p>On the arrival of General Stedman in the middle of May
(1887), the Upper Burma military police questions were
brought under discussion. The men, as I have said before,
were coming in fast. The sanctioned strength at this time
was fifteen thousand five hundred men. It was necessary to
determine the constitution of the force, its relation to the
Deputy Commissioners of districts, and the methods by which
it was to be rationed and kept supplied with necessaries.</p>

<p>These matters had been thought out before General Stedman's
arrival. They were now discussed with him in detail,
and the general lines to be followed were laid down. Briefly,
the following constitution was adopted:&mdash;</p>

<p>The keynote of Indian administration was, and I believe
still is, that the District Magistrate or Deputy Commissioner,
or by whatever name he may be called, is the
executive representative of the Government, and is responsible
for all matters in his district subject to the control of
the Commissioner of the division. He is especially responsible
for the peace of his district, and therefore the allocation
of the police force rests primarily with him. It was laid
down for the guidance of Deputy Commissioners that the
most important and central posts should be occupied by
fairly strong bodies of military police, to which should be
attached a few Burman constables, some of whom were to
be mounted, who were to collect information, receive reports,
and investigate cases. Between the military police posts, and
helping to link them up, were to be civil police stations
manned by Burmans exclusively, who were to be locally
recruited. A constant and systematic patrol was to be
maintained between the military police posts. The posts
were to be fortified and capable of defence by the garrison
remaining after the despatch of a patrol. It was laid down
as a fixed law that the reserve at headquarters must be
sufficient to provide a reasonably strong movable column
ready to reinforce any part of the district that might
need it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>The police force was divided into battalions, one to each
district, of a strength varying with the size and wants of
the district. To each battalion was appointed a commandant,
to all except a few very small battalions a
second-in-command, and to some more than one. These
officers were all selected from the Indian Army, and,
with very rare exceptions, were capable men. The interior
economy, the training, and the discipline of the men were
left to the commandants under the Inspector-General's
orders. With these matters the civil officials could not in
any way interfere.</p>

<p>It was found necessary from the first to restrain firmly
the tendency of the local officials to fritter away the strength
of the force in small posts. The moment anything occurred
they wanted to clap down a post on the disturbed spot; and
if this had been allowed to go on unchecked there would
not have been a man left to form a movable column or even
to send out a patrol of sufficient strength.</p>

<p>The number of men to be kept at headquarters, the minimum
strength of a post, and the minimum number of a
patrol had to be absolutely laid down by the Chief Commissioner's
order. At first the strength prescribed was too
small. After some experience, the lowest post garrison was
fixed at forty rifles, the minimum strength of a patrol at ten
rifles; and these orders were stringently enforced.</p>

<p>It was resolved to mount a certain number of the force,
and as soon as the ponies could be obtained&mdash;which was not
an easy matter, as the mounted infantry and the army transport
took up very many&mdash;about 10 per cent. of the men were
mounted.</p>

<p>Many of the military police who arrived in Burma in 1887
were newly raised and insufficiently trained levies, and until
the men had been drilled and taught to use their weapons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
it was impossible to do much towards relieving the soldiers
from the outposts. The rainy season was occupied in the
work of instruction. The task was performed under very
difficult conditions, for the men were often called away to
occupy posts and take part in active operations, and the
officers were few. The duty was well done, and by the end
of the autumn of 1887 we were in possession of an army,
which proved itself to be a most serviceable instrument for
reducing the country to order. The men, whether in the
field or in their lines, behaved exceedingly well.</p>

<p>Hardly less important than the constitution of the force
was its maintenance in a state of contentment and efficiency.
At the beginning of 1887 the number of military police
landed in Burma was between five and six thousand, and
as the year advanced the force was fast increasing. As the
men arrived they were rapidly distributed to the districts of
Upper Burma, and when trained were destined to relieve
the troops in distant outposts.</p>

<p>It was necessary to make immediate arrangements for
their rations and for renewing their clothing, equipment,
and ammunition; and also for the medical treatment of
the men. The principal medical officer of the field force
kindly undertook to organize the medical service, and
Captain Davis was engaged in working out the details.</p>

<p>Captain S. C. F. Peile, who, in 1885, had accompanied the
Bengal Brigade of the field force as executive commissariat
officer, had been selected to organize the supply business of
the police force. He was ready to commence work early in
April. The rains in Burma begin in May. Large numbers
of the police were stationed in the Eastern Division, where
cart traffic would soon become impossible, and also in the
Ruby Mines and other districts, which would soon be cut off
altogether.</p>

<p>I had found at several places that the military police at
outposts were not properly rationed and depended on the
military commissariat, which might at any time be moved
away.</p>

<p>The question arose as to the best method of supplying
our men. One of the conditions under which they had taken
service was that they should, as in the army, get money compensation
for dearness of provisions at a rate varying with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the price of flour. The men of the Indian army, when not
on active service, ration themselves, and are paid on this
principle. But this system presupposes that the necessary
provisions are procurable in the local markets.</p>

<p>The Burman markets afford everything that a Burman
needs&mdash;Burman caviare, a dainty that one has to be brought
up to; tinned milk, biscuits, sardines, and other delicacies;
but wheat flour, <i>ghi</i> (clarified butter), and various pulses
are not to be had. It is on such things that the fighting
man from Northern India lives.</p>

<p>After discussing the question carefully with Captain
Peile, it was determined, with the consent of the men, to
give no compensation and to serve out rations to all at a
fixed monthly charge. The Central Direction undertook to
deliver sufficient supplies at the headquarters of each
battalion. The distribution to the outposts was to be
managed by the battalion officers with the battalion transport.</p>

<p>I was able to say at the end of the year that the Supply
Department had worked well, and that without its aid the
organization of the military police could not have been
effected. The system has stood the trial of more than
twenty years, and it is doubtful whether any cheaper or
better system could have been devised for the supply of a
large force in similar circumstances.</p>

<p>The same establishment under Captain Peile provided for
the supply and renewal of clothing, arms, and ammunition.</p>

<p>These matters and the work connected with the many
parts of the administrative machine of the province gave me
ample occupation in Rangoon for some weeks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

DEALING WITH DACOITS</h2>


<p>It was about this time (May, 1887) that the news of the
surrender of the Limbin prince to Mr. Hildebrand, and
the submission of the influential Sawbwa of Möngnai
came to remove some of our anxieties. Lord Dufferin telegraphed
his congratulations to me: "These circumstances,"
he said, "greatly clear the air." They proved in effect that
we need not apprehend any very serious opposition in the
Shan States, and that there was no risk in holding that
country with a small force during the rains, on which point
there were apprehensions in some quarters.</p>

<p>Good news came also from Upper Burma. A noted gang,
led by men of more force than the ordinary leaders of
dacoits possessed, had surrendered to Major Ilderton, who
commanded a post at Wundwin, in the Meiktila district.
The gang was known by the name of the place, Hmawwaing,
where it made its retreat, and it had sustained
several severe attacks before the leaders gave in, of whom
two had been village headmen and the third had been a
Government servant under the King. The three had long
worked together; and before the annexation they had
dominated the northern part of Meiktila. They were
pardoned, and provision made for their support. Two of
them absconded. They soon found, however, that their
influence was gone. The country was weary of them. One
(Maung Kala) died of fever; a second (Myat Hmon) gave
himself up again. The third (Maung Ohn), the most
educated and best bred of them, had remained quiet.</p>

<p>It was now necessary for me to return to Upper Burma,
but I had not yet met Mr. Tucker, the Commissioner of the
Eastern Division. As the rains were beginning, and the
extension of the railway beyond Toungoo had not been
opened, I asked Mr. Tucker to meet me at Toungoo. I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
not spare time to march up to his headquarters. The
chief engineer of the Mandalay Railway, Mr. Buyers, was
pushing on the line as fast as he could. He had many
difficulties to contend with. The Burmans, although coming
readily to the work, were new to it. The working parties
had to be protected; the heavy forest in some divisions of
the line had to be cleared. I had seen Mr. Buyers and
satisfied myself that work was going on well.</p>

<p>I met Mr. Tucker, and received from him a fairly satisfactory
account of his division. Meiktila and Yamèthin
were almost quiet. Pyinmana was a difficult tract to reduce
to order. It is described in the <i>Burma Gazetteer</i> as "one
large forest with the exception of the immediate surroundings
of Pyinmana town and small patches of cultivation
near the villages and streams." The station had been for
some months almost besieged by dacoits, who took cover
close to our lines. So much so that the postmaster, who
came from a peaceful district, put up a notice closing
the post-office as "urgent private affairs" compelled him
to leave. It needed a good deal of peaceful persuasion to
induce him to remain at his work.</p>

<p>In April, May, and June the troops of Sir William Lockhart's
command, aided to some extent by the police, were
very active. The forests and all the hiding-places were
thoroughly explored and for the time at least cleared of
dacoits. Meanwhile the civil officers, under the energetic
direction of Mr. H. St. G. Tucker, vigorously disarmed the
district, making full use of the men of local influence. By
the middle of June, when Mr. Tucker met me, only small
bands were left, who were forced to conceal themselves,
and there was little trouble afterwards in this district. But
the difficult country of the Pegu Yoma between Pyinmana
and the Magwè district of the Southern Division continued
to harbour dacoits until 1890.</p>

<p>I returned to Rangoon from Toungoo and left for Upper
Burma on the 10th of June. Going by the river, I stopped
at all the towns on the way up, seeing the officers, inspecting
every part of the administration, and discussing affairs.</p>

<p>In Lower Burma the towns and villages showed their
wonted comfort and prosperity, the boats were as numerous
as ever, and the rice and other produce was waiting in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
abundance at the landing-places for the steamers. The
disturbances had had little effect on trade.</p>

<p>The country inland to the west of the river was still
harassed by predatory gangs in the wilder parts, and the
police did not appear able to suppress them.</p>

<p>There was no need, however, for the aid of the soldiers.
I was able to reduce the number of outposts occupied by
troops, and I would have reduced them still more, but that
the General Commanding in Lower Burma was unable to
provide barrack-room for the men occupying them. It
was clearly time to take up the question of reducing the
garrison of Lower Burma.</p>

<p>It was not a good thing to accustom the civil officers, the
police, or the people to depend on detachments of troops
scattered over the country, and it certainly was not good
for the discipline and efficiency of the men. The conduct
of the soldiers, however, was excellent, and the people
welcomed them. I found a general unwillingness to lose
the sense of security which their presence gave; and
possibly also the profits of dealings with them. The Indian
soldiers and the Burmans were on excellent terms. Even
where the men were quartered in the monasteries the
Pongyis did not want them to leave.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>At Thayetmyo the region of dacoit gangs and disturbances
was reached. The main trouble appeared to be in
what may be termed Bo Swè's country, which lay on
the right bank of the river, reaching from the old British
Burma boundary to a line going westward with a slight
southerly curve from Minhla to the Arakan mountains.
Part of the trouble I thought arose from the fact that
the jurisdiction of the Lower Burma command had been
extended so as to cover this country, while the civil jurisdiction
belonged to the Minbu district of Upper Burma.
This impeded free communication between the civil and
military authorities. I transferred the tract to Thayetmyo,
made it a subdivision of that district, and put a young and
energetic officer in charge. The tract across the river was
similarly treated.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<p>I was now in Upper Burma again. Minbu on both sides
of the river (it extended to both banks at this time) was very
disturbed. Ôktama's power was not broken. Villages were
attacked and burnt, and friendly headmen were murdered.</p>

<p>Pagan, the next district, was not much better; and
divided as it was by the river, and containing the troublesome
Yaw tract, the civil authorities were somewhat handicapped.
From Pagan I crossed over to Pakokku, even then
a fine trading town and the centre, as it still is, of the
boat-building industry. The town in 1887 had a population
of about 5,000, which had increased in 1901 to 19,000. It
was well laid out with handsome avenues of tamarind-trees.
Standing on good sandy soil and well drained, it was a fine
site for the headquarters of a district.</p>

<p>The town and its neighbourhood had been skilfully
governed by a lady, the widow of the old Governor, who had
died thirty years before. Her son, a very fat and apparently
stupid youth, was titular town-mayor (<i>Myo-thugyi</i>); but
because he was suspected of playing false, through fear of
the insurgents, he had been superseded, and a stranger
from Lower Burma appointed as magistrate.</p>

<p>The wisdom of importing men from Lower Burma was
always, to my mind, doubtful, and in this case was peculiarly
open to objection, as it was a slight to the widow, who was
undoubtedly an able woman, and had joined the British
cause from the first.</p>

<p>It was said that in 1885 she was ordered by the King's
Government to block the channel by sinking boats, of which
there were always plenty at Pakokku; she let all the Upper
Burma craft go&mdash;for a consideration, of course&mdash;and sunk
some boats which belonged to British Burma. She was
alleged to have made a thousand pounds by this transaction,
which is very characteristic of the East.</p>

<p>I called on this old lady and had some conversation with
her, and I would gladly have seen more of her, as she
appeared to be a woman of some power. It was arranged
to remove the Lower Burman magistrate and to send an
English Assistant Commissioner, who would work through
the hereditary Governor and his mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>At Myingyan, the next station, I found the best of my
officers was Captain Hastings,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> the commandant of the military
police, who was fast making his men into a very fine
battalion, with which before long he did excellent service.
I waited at Myingyan to see General Sir Robert Low, who
had been at Mandalay. He was satisfied about the progress
in his district, except in the country about Salin, Ôktama's
country, and in Taundwingyi, which he said was full of
dacoits, and would probably be their last abiding-place.</p>

<p>It was a true prophecy, as I learnt to my sorrow. Partly
owing to the very difficult country on its east border, and
partly, perhaps even more, to the incompetence and weakness
of the local officers, this district became my shame
and despair. But at this time I had not been over the
Taundwingyi country.</p>

<p>My next halt was at Myinmu, the headquarters of a
subdivision of the Sagaing district, on the right bank, about
thirty miles below Sagaing. Mr. Macnabb, a young soldier
who had lately joined the Commission, was there as subdivisional
officer. His report was not very satisfactory.
Myinmu, for some reason or other, was especially obnoxious
to the insurgents and was repeatedly attacked. Even quite
recently there has been some trouble at Myinmu, although
it is now a station on the railway which goes from Sagaing
to the Chindwin.</p>

<p>Ava, which is a little further up on the opposite side of
the river, was at that time a separate district. But except
that it was the old capital of Burma, and was a favourite
ground for dacoits, there was no reason for keeping a
Deputy Commissioner there, and little ordinary work for
him. It was soon to be added to the Sagaing district, to
which it still belongs. There were no troops at this time
at Ava; the Indian military police were good.</p>

<p>I found the experiment of training Burmans as military
police still going on in Ava. It will be remembered that the
first idea was to recruit half the force from the Burmans
and other local races. The commandant called my attention
to the gross waste of money that was involved in this
experiment. The Burman officers were hopelessly unfit.
One had been imported from Lower Burma; the other was
a half-caste, a poor specimen of his kind in every way.
They were disbanded as soon as possible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Shwètakyat promontory opposite Sagaing.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
<p>The dacoits hung about the country under the Ava
Deputy Commissioner for a long time. His jurisdiction did
not extend over more than three hundred and fifty square
miles, but it was harried by three noted guerilla leaders&mdash;Shwè
Yan, who occupied the country on the borders of the
Kyauksè and Ava districts; Bo Tok, who frequented the
borders of Ava and Myingyan; and the third, Shwè Yan
the second, who ravaged the south-west part of the district.
The two last were killed by British troops. The first and
the most formidable of the three was reported to have
disappeared.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned here, as illustrating the persistence
of the insurgents and the apparently endless nature of the
task, which demanded all our patience and perseverance,
that in the spring of 1888 Ava was as bad as ever. There
were nineteen well-known leaders&mdash;"named varieties,"
as a gardener might call them&mdash;who, in the words of the
official report, "held the countryside in terror." Early in
May, Shwè Yan, whose disappearance had been reported, was
again on foot with a strong body of followers. A force of
troops and police which encountered him lost two British
officers.</p>

<p>From Ava I went over to Sagaing and inspected the
station and the police, and crossed to Mandalay the same
day. Sir George White met me on landing, and I rode up
with him to my quarters on the wall.</p>

<p>This journey had occupied me eighteen days. I left
Rangoon on the 10th of June, and reached Mandalay on
the 28th. But the time had been well spent in gaining
information and in making or renewing acquaintance with
the district officers. I had inspected all stations on the
way, and had been able to dispose of many questions on
the spot. When I was not on shore, the office work and
correspondence kept me busy. My secretary and I had to
write on the skylight of the boat, as there was no accommodation
of any kind except a few dressing-rooms below,
which in that climate and at that season were suffocating.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

CIVIL AND MILITARY WORKS</h2>


<p>Nothing has been said as yet about roads and communications,
the most powerful of all aids in pacifying
a disturbed country. The plains of India in most provinces
lend themselves to military operations, and for the greater
part of the year an army can move about at will. In
Burma the long and heavy rains, the numerous streams,
and the extensive and dense forests and jungles, make
campaigning very difficult. The country, in Sir George
White's words, quoted before, "is one huge military
obstacle."</p>

<p>Sir Charles Bernard had not lost sight of this part of
his work. With the aid of Mr. Richard, of the Public
Works Department, a most able superintending engineer,
as much as possible had been done. No time had been
lost.</p>

<p>In Mandalay itself, in 1886, fifteen miles of road had been
re-formed, the bridges renewed and metal consolidated, and
in the country generally more than two hundred miles of
roads had been taken in hand and partially finished. Tracks
one hundred feet in width had been cleared of forest and
jungle between many of the military posts, a work in which
the military officers took a large part. As our occupation
of the country became closer, more roads and more tracks
were called for. These forest tracks can hardly be called
engineering works, but they were of first importance for
the free movement of troops. The time during which road-making
can be carried on is short in Burma, owing to
the great rainfall. The dry zone in the centre of the
province, where the climate is no impediment, is precisely
the country where roads are least necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Eastern Governments as a rule trouble themselves very
little about roads and public buildings of a useful kind.
In Burma there were pagodas and monasteries innumerable.
But roads and prosaic buildings, such as court-houses and
jails, received little attention. Such a thing as a trunk road
did not exist.</p>

<p>Controlling the engineering establishment in Lower
Burma there was a chief engineer, who was also Public
Works secretary. His hands were full. To ask him to
supervise the work in the new province as well was to
lay on him an impossible task and to ensure the
waste of much money. A chief engineer for Upper
Burma was appointed at my request, and Major Gracey,
R.E., who was selected for the post, had arrived in
Burma. I have met with few men who had more power
of work and of getting their subordinates to work, or who
took greater care of the public money, than Major Gracey.</p>

<p>On his arrival, in consultation with Colonel Cumming,
the expenditure was examined and the whole situation
discussed in Rangoon, and afterwards both officers met me
in Mandalay. There was much difficulty in obtaining a
sufficient number of engineers and a competent engineering
establishment. The Indian Public Works service in the
higher grades is recruited in England, and the subordinates
are appointed in India. Service in Burma was for
many reasons unpopular with men trained in India.
The other provinces were not anxious to part with
their best men. Hence the men who came to Burma
were frequently unwilling and sometimes not very
efficient.</p>

<p>The difficulty was to apportion the existing establishment
as fairly as possible between the two provinces, so as to
give Major Gracey a fair number of men with Burman
experience.</p>

<p>With Major Gracey's help everything went on well, and
as fast as possible. A list of the work done in 1887
would fill a page. The grant for military works in that
year was £317,500. Permanent barracks at Mandalay and
Bhamo, and a great number of temporary buildings to
accommodate troops, were erected all over Burma in the
first year of Major Gracey's tenure. Many of the temporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
buildings were put up by military and civil officers; but
after a time, all military buildings were carried out by
the Public Works Department.</p>

<p>The Civil Works grant was nearly £350,000.</p>

<p>The provinces had no court-houses, no jails, no places
of detention at the police stations, and no barracks or
accommodation for the military police. Two larger jails,
one at Mandalay for eight hundred prisoners and one at
Myingyan for one thousand, although not yet completed,
were already occupied. Of three smaller prisons at Monywa,
Pagan, and Minbu, one was finished and two partially,
but enough to be of use. At ten stations small lock-ups
were being built for persons arrested by the police. The
jails and lock-ups were pressed on, because the existing
arrangements for confining prisoners inherited from the
Burmese Government were insufferable, and in some cases
inhuman.</p>

<p>Provision had to be made for housing some thousands of
military police. At the headquarters of eighteen districts
accommodation had to be provided for about half a
battalion, with hospitals, guard-rooms, magazines, and cook-houses.
These buildings, especially the hospitals with
accommodation for 8 per cent. of the strength, were constructed
of good permanent material. The barracks, officers'
quarters, stables, and the like were built in the cheapest
way consistent with comfort and health. The condition
of the country in a year or two would permit, it was
expected, of a reduction of the military police force, or at
least of a change in its disposition; the barrack accommodation
would not be permanently wanted, but the
hospitals could be used for the civil population.</p>

<p>Added to all this building work, roads to the extent of
five hundred miles, of which one hundred and fifty were hill
roads, were laid out and made passable, raised and bridged
in most cases, and in some places metalled. These works
were scattered over the province from Bhamo to the old
frontier of British Burma. In designing the roads it was
remembered that the great trunk lines of communication
were the great rivers in the centre and west of the province,
and the railway in the east. All the main roads were
designed to be feeders to the rivers or the rails. In addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to the larger roads, many hundreds of miles of tracks and
rough district roads were cut through the forest and jungles,
and a survey was begun, to open up the difficult Yaw
country, through which we had afterwards to push troops.
(<i>vide</i> Chapter XXI.). I think it may be claimed that
our engineers did their duty.</p>

<p>The middle of Upper Burma, the dry zone, as it is called,
differs in climatic conditions from the country to the south
and north of it. The rainfall is deficient, and droughts,
sometimes severe, are not unknown.</p>

<p>The Burmese rulers were capable of large conceptions,
but they lacked skill; and their great irrigation schemes,
attempted without sufficient science, were foredoomed to
failure. The largest works of this class existing, when
we took the country, were the Mandalay and Shwèbo Canals,
which were of little use, as even where the construction
was not faulty they had been allowed to go to ruin. In
Kyauksè Salin (Minbu district) and elsewhere there were
extensive canals of a less ambitious nature, which although
neglected were still of much service. Even in the turmoil
of 1886 and the pressure of what was in fact a state of
war, Sir Charles Bernard found time to attend to the irrigation
systems; and as soon as a skilled engineer could be
obtained from India, and funds allotted, the work of irrigation
was tackled in earnest. The first business was to examine
the existing systems and see whether they could be made
use of. Before I left Burma in December, 1890, I had
the pleasure of knowing that this work was in hand, and
that further deterioration from neglect had been stopped,
and also that new schemes were under consideration.</p>

<p>The expenditure in Upper Burma at this time was very
great. An army of fourteen thousand men cannot be kept
in the field for nothing. The military police force was
a second army, and there was besides all the cost of the civil
administration. The incoming revenue was in comparison
insignificant. In 1886-7 it had been £250,000 in round
numbers, in 1887-8 it rose to £500,000&mdash;not enough to cover
the public works expenditure alone.</p>

<p>It was not wonderful, therefore, that the Government of
India, whose finances at the time were by no means happy,
should be nervous about the expenditure. They were most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
gentle and considerate in the matter; and although it was
evident that our success in Burma would be measured in
England mainly by the financial results, no pressure was put
upon me to get in revenue, and I felt the pinch chiefly in the
difficulty of getting an adequate and competent engineering
establishment and immediate funds for works, the urgency
of which was less apparent to the Government of India
than to me on the spot. With Lord Dufferin's backing
I obtained what I wanted, and I hope I did not exhibit an
indecent importunity.</p>

<p>I had considered and reported to the Finance Department
all possible means of raising the revenue. On the
whole, my conclusion was that we had to look rather to
existing sources than to new taxation, which in a country
not yet completely subdued and of which we had imperfect
knowledge would have been inexpedient. The excise
revenue might have been made profitable, but we were
debarred from interfering for the time with the regulations
made and sanctioned (somewhat hastily, perhaps) by the
Government of India, immediately after the annexation.</p>

<p>Under the circumstance, the best and quickest method
of improving the financial conditions was clearly the reduction
of the field force. This was already under discussion.
The initial step had been taken and one regiment
of Native Infantry had been sent back to India. The
military police had begun to relieve the troops in the
outposts. The Major-General, Sir George White (who
in addition to his merits as a gallant leader and good
strategist, was an able administrator), was careful always
of public money, and in perfect accord with the civil
administration. He desired his men to be relieved as quickly
as possible.</p>

<p>It was a matter, however, in which it was unsafe to
rush, and in which a heavy responsibility rested on me.
Events were happening from time to time which warned
us that we were not yet out of the wood. On the 3rd of
June, for example, the troops at Pyinulwin, forty miles
from Mandalay, led by Colonel May, had attacked a
stockade held on behalf of the Setkya Mintha, a pretender.
Darrah, Assistant Commissioner, was killed, an
officer named Cuppage badly wounded, and several men
lost. Hkam Leng (see Chapter XX.) was active in the
Möngmit Country.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<p>The Commissioners of the Northern and Central Divisions
were urging me to have the large and numerous islands
between Mandalay and Sagaing cleared of the gangs who
held them. They represented the necessity of a river patrol.
The cry from the Southern Division was for launches. The
Commissioner wrote that the only boat in his division fit
for service was that assigned to the military authorities;
and this was the day after Captain Hext's arrival on his
mission from India, to persuade me to reduce my demand
for boats.</p>

<p>The Deputy Commissioner for Mandalay reported that
there was a dacoit leader stockaded within forty miles
of Mandalay, and that he was unable to get a force to
turn him out of his position.</p>

<p>At the same time (July, 1887) bad news came from the
Ye-u district. Two pretenders had appeared with a considerable
following. As a prelude they had burnt villages,
crucified one of the village headmen, and committed other
brutalities. The civil administration was obliged to ask
for help from the soldiers in this case. The weather was
fine, and the country which these men had occupied was
a good field for cavalry. The Hyderabad Cavalry were
in the field at once, and the Inspector-General of Police
was able to get together a hundred mounted military police
and send them to help. A force from the Chindwin side
co-operated. The gathering was very soon scattered. One
of the leaders died of fever and the other escaped for a
time, but was afterwards captured in the Lower Chindwin
district, where he was attempting to organize another
rising.</p>

<p>I was compelled in Sagaing also to ask Sir George
White's assistance. The Sagaing Police battalion was
backward in training and not fit for outpost work in a
bad district. The death of Hla U had been expected
to bring peace. But it now appeared that the district
on both sides of the Mu was in the hands of three or
four dacoit leaders who collected a fixed revenue from
each village, which was spared so long as the demand
was paid. Any headman who failed to pay was murdered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
remorselessly. In some cases the man's wife and children
were killed before his face, to add to the sting of death.</p>

<p>The system in the Sagaing and other districts much
resembled&mdash;in its machinery, not altogether in its methods&mdash;the
organization of the Nationalists in Ireland.</p>

<p>At my request Sir George White consented to occupy the
district closely, and although the gangs were not caught
or brought to justice, some protection was given to the
peaceful part of the population until we were ready later
on to take the district in hand and destroy the gangs.</p>

<p>In Sagaing, as in some other cases, the local officers had
been ignorant of what was going on around them. It was
believed to be quiet because we had no touch with the
people, and they told us nothing.</p>

<p>The intention in referring to these events is to show why
caution was needed in the matter of relieving the troops.
It must be remembered that a very large proportion of the
military police had received very little training before their
arrival. With the exception of some two thousand men,
all were recruits entirely untaught in drill or discipline.
The employment of such raw men on outpost duty under
native officers whom they did not know was not without risk.
In many cases the risk had to be faced, and consequently
some disasters were inevitable. Progress was slow, but
under the conditions it was good. "To instil discipline
into so large a body of young soldiers," wrote the Inspector-General
(General Stedman), "was a far more difficult task
than to teach them the rudiments of drill. By discipline
must be understood not only good conduct in quarters and
prompt obedience to the orders of superiors, but the
necessity of sticking to one another in the field and the
habit of working together as a welded body."</p>

<p>Before I left Mandalay again for Lower Burma, Sir
George White and I had arrived at an agreement regarding
the force which it was necessary to keep up. We were
able to propose the abolition of the field force and
the reduction of the garrison by one regiment of
British Infantry, two regiments of Indian Cavalry, eight
regiments of Indian Infantry, and one British Mountain
Battery. The allocation of the troops and police was reviewed
in consultation with the Commissioners of Divisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and so made that the one force supplemented the other.
The reduction was to take effect from the spring of 1888.</p>

<p>We were now about to enter on a new development of
the British occupation. The civil officers, supported by the
military police, were to take the responsibility of keeping
order. The soldiers were there ready to help if need be,
but they were not to be called out except for operations
beyond the power of the police.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

A VISIT TO BHAMO</h2>


<p>I had arranged to hold a Durbar at Mandalay on the
5th of August, in order to meet the notables of Burma,
and such of the Shan chiefs as might be able to come, face
to face, and to make them understand the position, the
intentions, and the power of the British Government. I
hoped, perhaps not in vain, that the spirit of my words
might penetrate to the towns and villages of Burma.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I had not visited Bhamo, and I decided to go
there. I had sent for Mr. Hildebrand, whom I wanted to
consult about the operations in the Shan States which were
to be undertaken in the coming cold season. He arrived
before I left Mandalay for Bhamo, and as he evidently
needed rest, I asked him to remain at Government House
until my return.</p>

<p>I found Bhamo a disappointing place. A very dirty,
miserable kind of village, arranged in two streets parallel
to the river. At the back lay a marsh or lagoon, which
evidently was at one time a channel for the backwater of
the river. Conservancy there was none, and the stench
from the streets, the lagoon, and even the bank of the river
was sickening. Considering that the place had been the
headquarters of a district since our occupation, and a cantonment
for British and Indian troops, it was not much to
be proud of. But the soldiers and the civil officers had
been well occupied with more pressing business.</p>

<p>The Chinese were the most prominent of the population.
They were all, it was said, opium smokers, and seldom
moved until near midday. They managed notwithstanding
to make money, and to retire with fortunes after a few
years. I anticipated a large increase of the trade with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
China, but doubted if the town could grow much on its
present site.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> As to the trade, it could not make much progress
on account of the cost of transport between Bhamo and
Tengyueh, the risk of attack by Kachins, and the
exactions and oppressions of the Chinese Customs officials,
who at one time had maintained a <i>likin</i> station within the
British boundary not far from Bhamo. There was another
route used by traders, which went by Mansi and Namkham,
a Shan State on the Shwèli. Since the Kachins in the
country south of Bhamo have been subjugated, the Chinese
caravans have preferred the Namkham route; and at
present although the Kachins have ceased to raid, and
much has been done of late to improve the road to Tengyueh,
the trade has not returned to that channel.</p>

<p>A survey for a light railway to Tengyueh has been made,
but a strange indifference exists to the benefits certain, as I
think, to result from making the line. The construction of
a railway between Northern Burma and Yunnan has always
appeared to me essential to the full development of the
province. The opportunity has been lost and France has
anticipated us. It would be a difficult and expensive work
no doubt, but whether more difficult than the French line
may be doubted. Even now, after twenty years, it has not
been surveyed beyond the Kunlon ferry, and the opinion of
persons without engineering knowledge has been accepted
as sufficient to condemn it. But we may still hope.
Napoleon crossing the Alps might have scoffed at the
notion of a railway to Italy.</p>

<p>There is a vast area of land in Upper Burma waiting for
population to cultivate it, and if communications were
made easy, the Chinese Shans and possibly Chinese and
Panthays from Yunnan might be induced to settle in the
northern districts. The Chinese and Burmans are akin,
and the offspring of Chinese fathers and Burman mothers
have the good qualities of both races, which cannot be said
of other crosses.</p>

<p>I returned to Mandalay from Bhamo before the end of
July, having learnt and arranged much, especially in consultation
with Major Adamson, the Deputy Commissioner,
regarding the contemplated occupation of Mogaung. The
stations on the river were all inspected on the way down.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>
<p>I found Mr. Hildebrand waiting for me, and discussed
with him and with Sir George White the plans for an expedition
to the Shan States.</p>

<p>The Durbar was held on the 5th of August, and I think
was a useful function. It was held in the great Eastern
Hall of the Palace, the place where the King of Burma
used to give audience to his feudatories and his people.
The ex-ministers and some of the Shan Sawbwas were
present, and the great hall was crowded with notables and
officials from Mandalay and other districts. It must have
been to them a striking occasion, and to many of them,
perhaps, not altogether pleasant. To such as had any
patriotic feeling, and no doubt many of them had, the
representative of a foreign Government standing in front
of the empty throne must have been the abomination of
desolation standing where it ought not.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>My duty, however, was not to show sympathy with
sentiment of this kind, but to impress them with the
permanence, the benevolence, and the power of the new
Government. In an appendix I have given the text of my
speech and some comments upon it taken from an article
in the <i>Times</i> newspaper of the 13th of September, 1887.
Two of the high Burman officials who had formerly been
in the King's service, the Kinwun Mingyi, one of the Ministers
of the State, and the Myowun, or City Governor of
Mandalay, both of whom had given great assistance to the
British Government, received decorations. The former
was made a Companion of the Star of India and the latter
of the Indian Empire. I was glad to get the following
commendation from Lord Dufferin.</p>

<p>He wrote: "I congratulate you on your Durbar and
upon the excellent speech you made on the occasion. It
was full of go and good sense, and will convince everybody
that you really mean business."</p>

<p>There were fresh rumours at this time (August, 1887)
of hostile intentions on the part of the Chinese, of gatherings
of soldiers and bandits on the frontier, of the presence
of auxiliaries from Yunnan with San Ton Hon in Theinni.
There was no foundation in fact for any of these rumours;
Mr. Warry, the Chinese adviser, placed no faith in them,
and I did not believe in them. But they were repeated
in the newspapers, magnified in gossip, and disturbed the
public mind.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<p>The best way of silencing these rumours was to make
our occupation of the northernmost district, Mogaung,
effectual, and to establish a definite control in the Shan
States. In concert with the Major-General, proposals for
effecting both these objects had been prepared and were
before the Government of India, and I knew that the
Viceroy approved them.</p>

<p>In neither case was serious opposition expected. Detailed
accounts of both movements will be found in
separate chapters of this book. In the case of the Shan
States, the character of the expedition was essentially
peaceful and conciliatory. The escorts given to the two
civil officers were strong enough to deter, or if necessary
overcome, opposition and support the dignity of our representatives.
But unless hostilities broke out, in which
case the military commanders would necessarily become
supreme, the control was vested in the senior civil officer,
Mr. Hildebrand. It is unnecessary to say more here, except
that with Sir George White's help everything was done
to keep down the cost. Not a man more than was absolutely
necessary was sent. The Shan plateau, at this
time nowhere prosperous, was in some parts on the verge
of famine; not from drought or other climatic cause, but
simply from the cat-and-dog life the people had led for
some years. No supplies could be obtained in the country.
It was necessary to ration the troops for four or five months,
and the cost of transport was heavy.</p>

<p>Every one felt, however, that cost what it might, the
work we had undertaken must be completed. Nothing
could have justified us in leaving the Shan country any
longer in a state of anarchy; and I doubt if even the
most narrow-minded Under Secretary in the Financial
Department dared to raise objections to the needful expenditure.
It may be permitted to say here that no money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
was better spent. The Shan plateau for lovely scenery,
for good climate, and I believe for its natural wealth, is
proving itself a most valuable possession. Lord Dufferin
thoroughly approved of the action taken in these cases.</p>

<p>It was a relief to deal with these larger matters. They
were less harassing than the constant stream of administrative
details of every kind which leave a man at the
head of a large province barely time to think of his most
important problems. The demands from the Secretary of
State for information, which came through the Government
of India, wasted a great deal of time. Members of Parliament
who cannot force themselves into notice in other
ways, take up a subject like Burma, of which no one knows
anything, and ask questions which the Secretary of State
has to answer. Frequently there was little foundation
for these questions, and when the call came to answer
them, it took both time and labour to ascertain what they
were all about. Correspondents of newspapers, not so
much perhaps out of malice&mdash;although that is not quite
unknown&mdash;as from the necessities of their profession are
greedy for sensational news. They know that the English
public prefer to think that their servants abroad are either
fools or scoundrels. If everything is reported to be going
well and the officers to be doing their duty, few will credit
it, and none will be interested in it. But hint vaguely at
dark intrigues or horrible atrocities, ears are cocked at
once, and the newspaper boys sweep in the pence.</p>

<p>Few of the uninitiated would believe how much time
has to be given by the head of an Indian province to
the placing of his men. In a climate like Burma, and
under the conditions obtaining in 1887, frequent and sudden
sickness compels officers to take leave. The civil staff
of the province was barely sufficient if no losses occurred.
If a man fell out it was often difficult to supply his place,
and if a good man went down, as they often did, it was
sometimes impossible to find a good man to succeed him.
Writing to Lord Dufferin at this time (September, 1887)
of one of the worst districts, I said: "I have not been able
to put a good man there yet, but I hope to have a man
soon. It all depends on getting hold of the right man."
In a settled province the personal factor is not so important;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
but in a newly annexed country it is everything. Even
in the oldest province in India, if a fool is put in charge
of a district and kept there long enough you will have
trouble of some sort.</p>

<p>Much has been heard of late years of the evils of transfers,
and even Viceroys have talked as if the carelessness or
favouritism of provincial governors were responsible for
the mischief. The real cause in my experience is the inadequacy
of the staff of officers. If one man falls sick and
has to leave his district, two or three transfers may become
inevitable. The Government of India realize no doubt that
the staff, of the smaller provinces especially, is inadequate.
If they give a liberal allowance of Englishmen the expense
is increased and promotion becomes too slow. If they
cut down the staff, the head of the province has to tear
his hair and worry through somehow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

DISARMAMENT: TROUBLE IN PAGYI</h2>


<p>It was in Rangoon at this time that I made up my mind
to disarm the whole province, Upper and Lower,
rigorously, as soon as possible. I wrote to Lord Dufferin on
September 30, 1887, as follows: "I am of opinion that the
time has come for the complete disarming of the whole
province, except perhaps on some exposed frontiers. The
firearms in the hands of dacoits are evidently much fewer,
but they continually replenish their stock by taking arms
from villagers and Burman police. I would temper the
measure in the Lower province by giving arms to selected
Karens and Burmans, who should enrol themselves as special
constables. As the Burmans hate nothing so much as
signing any engagement to serve for a term, few of them
would enrol themselves.</p>

<p>"I should fix the number of such special police myself, for
each district."</p>

<p>The Baptist missionaries, I feared, would not look upon
the scheme with favour. The loyalty of the Karens and the
benefits of their organization under their missionaries, to
whom the Government, as I have said on a former page,
owes much, were not questioned. But it was not admissible
that the Government of Burma should prefer one
race more than another, and I had been warned by one of
the missionaries themselves that Burman ill-will had been
excited by the preference given to Karens in raising bodies
of police auxiliaries during the disturbances.</p>

<p>By laying down conditions, fair and necessary in themselves,
which men of the one race were likely to accept, but
would be less acceptable to the other, as much discrimination
was made between Karens and Burmans as was
needful or decent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>In Upper Burma, Sir Charles Bernard had ordered the
withdrawal of firearms from the villagers, soon after the
annexation. It was not possible to carry it out effectually
at that time. It was not until 1888 that I had arranged all
the details and could put the orders fully into force. It is
admitted generally to have been a beneficial measure, and
to have helped very much to pacify the country and to
put down dacoity. It is a pity that the disarmament
of Lower Burma had not been enforced many years before.
But no accumulation of facts are enough to destroy a
prejudice, and for a long time my action was violently,
I might say virulently, denounced in the Press and in
Parliament.</p>

<p>The wisdom and necessity of this measure has come,
I think, to be admitted by most people and was never
doubted by my successors, who wisely disarmed the Chins
at the cost of a serious rising and a hill campaign. The
number of firearms taken from the villagers amounted
in the years 1888 and 1889 to many thousands. Most
of them were very antiquated and fit for a museum of
ancient weapons. But they served the purpose of the
Burman brigand, and not a few good men, British and
Indian, died by them.</p>

<p>The Village Regulation was passed on October 28, 1887.
It established on a legal basis the ancient and still existing
constitution of Upper Burma. While emphasizing the
responsibility of the village headman, it gave him sufficient
powers and the support of the law. It also enacted the
joint responsibility of the village in the case of certain
crimes; the duty of all to resist the attacks of gangs
of robbers and to take measures to protect their villages
against such attacks. In the case of stolen cattle which
were traced to a village, it placed on it the duty of carrying
on the tracks or paying for the cattle. It gave the district
officer power to remove from a village, and cause to reside
elsewhere, persons who were aiding and abetting dacoits
and criminals. This enactment, the genesis of which I
have given in a former chapter, was framed in accordance
with the old customary law and with the feelings of the
people. It strengthened our hands more and gave us
a tighter grip on the country than anything else could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
done. Without the military police no law could have done
much. Without the Village Regulation, the military police
would have been like a ship without a rudder.</p>

<p>When the open season of 1887-8 began, the administration
was in a strong position to deal with the disorder still
prevailing. It was prepared as it never had been before.
There was the law enforcing village responsibility, and
enabling the magistrate to deal summarily with the persons
who were really the life of dacoity; those who, living an
apparently honest life, were the intelligence and commissariat
agents of the gangs. All the details of disarmament
had not been settled, but every opportunity was taken of
withdrawing arms, and in the case of dacoit leaders or their
followers, or of rebel villages, the surrender of a certain
number of firearms was made a condition of the grant of
pardon. Lastly, the military police organization was
complete, and the physical force needed to enforce the law
was thus provided in a ready and convenient form.</p>

<p>The rains were over, and I anticipated that the dacoits
would again become active. I also thought it probable that
the inexperienced police would meet with some disasters.</p>

<p>The country now in the Thayetmyo district, frequented
by Bo Swè, was quieter. He was a fugitive with a diminished
following. Early in October we were cheered by the
news of his destruction. The Viceroy wired his congratulations.</p>

<p>It may seem unworthy of the Government of a great
country to rejoice at the death of a brigand whose influence
did not extend over more than a few hundred square miles.
It was not the man's death, but all that it meant. A sign
of the coming end&mdash;slowly coming, it may be, but still the
coming end&mdash;of a very weary struggle with a system of
resistance which was costing us many good men and a
lavish expenditure of money. Bo Swè was ridden down
by a party of Colonel Clements' Mounted Infantry belonging
to the Lower Burma command. He and his men were
surprised in a ravine, and many, including Bo Swè, killed.</p>

<p>There were still left the broken remnants of the leader's
following. Active officers, with special powers and sufficient
police, were placed in charge of the Northern subdivisions
of the Thayetmyo district on both sides of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
river, and order was established before the end of 1887.
But in Upper Burma the districts of the Southern Division
remained in a very bad state. Ôktama was still master,
especially in the valley of the Môn. I had not found the
right men for Minbu, and the weakness of the civil
administration was represented as an evil, not without
reason, by the military commanders.</p>

<p>The following extract from a letter dated 1st of October,
1887, from the Commissioner of the Southern Division will
give a better idea of the state of things than mere general
phrases:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On 16th August, Po Saung, an informer, was caught
and killed by Bo Cho's gang in Pagan.</p>

<p>"On 29th August, Yan Sin, a dacoit who had submitted,
was caught and killed by Nga Kway in Pagan.</p>

<p>"On 5th September, at Kôkkozu village in Pauk, the
dacoits tried to catch the thugyi, but failed, and caught and
murdered his wife.</p>

<p>"Su Gaung, a mounted police constable, was shot while
carrying letters between Myingyan and Natogyi on 16th
September.</p>

<p>"In Lindaung, Pagan district, the thugyi was murdered a
month ago and Thade's gang on 10th September attempted
to capture his son, but failed, and plundered the village.</p>

<p>"On 29th September, Nurtama in Minbu, which is the
headquarters of the Kyabin Myoôk, was attacked. The
Myoôk's and seven other houses were burned; no one was
killed. The Myoôk lived here in fear of his life for some
time. He sleeps at night at Sinbyugyun, on the other
side of the Salin Creek, and if he sleeps at Nurtama he
does not sleep in his own house, but in a little post which
he has built. He has taken a guard of ten men from
Sinbyugyun.</p>

<p>"On 24th September at Sagyun, in Myingyan district,
Custance's interpreter and the thugyi of Welôn were breakfasting
in the village; they were attacked, and the interpreter
killed, his head being nearly severed from his body. The
thugyi escaped with a slight wound."</p>

<p>More than one attack was made on Yénangyaung, the
village near the oil-wells, with the object of killing the
Burman headman. The raiders did not secure him, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
they carried off his wife and daughter and set fire to a number
of boats, loaded with oil. The military police (a few raw
Punjabis without a British officer) were flurried and did
nothing. These attacks made them nervous, and shortly
afterwards, taking a forest officer, who was going down the
river with a white umbrella<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> over his head, for a leader of
rebels, they fired volleys at him until he and his crew had
to get out of the boat and cling to the side of it. Fortunately
the men shot badly and no one was hit. The forest
officer complained loudly of the indignity he had suffered,
which he thought was not within the letter of his bond.
It was believed that the men who had made the attack on
Yénangyaung had come from the right bank of the Irrawaddy
River. There was a patrol launch on this part of the
river, and it had called several times at Yénangyaung before
the attack. We had not enough boats to patrol a long
stretch of river effectually, and it was easy for the dacoits
to watch the steamer as it went up or down and time their
crossing. The Commissioner, therefore, collected the
boats on the right bank and put them under guards until
confidence was restored. The towns on the left bank
below Pagan were reported to live in dread of attack.</p>

<p>Meanwhile trouble broke out in the Chindwin district, on
the west of the river. Two leaders of revolt had appeared
in this region. One was the Bayingan, or Viceroy, of the
Myingun Prince whose name has already been mentioned.
He was known to have left the Mandalay district with the
object of raising a disturbance in the Chindwin. The other
was a person called the Shwègyobyu Prince, who at the
time of the annexation had been a vaccinator in the
Government service in the Thayetmyo district. He must
have been a man of considerable character and ambition,
for when the war began he went up to the Chindwin
country and established himself at Kanlè, in the difficult
hills of the Pondaung range. He assumed, with what right
is not known, the style and title of "Prince," and proceeded
to enrol men to resist the foreigners.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>While we were congratulating ourselves on the destruction
of Bo Swè and his gang, news came down that Pagyi
was up. As yet we had not been able to occupy this
region. It was a country of hills and ravines, densely
wooded and also very unhealthy. It had been impossible to
find civil officers to administer it, or men, either soldiers or
police, to occupy it. The people had always more or less
managed their own affairs under their own headmen, and as
a temporary makeshift we had endeavoured to continue this
arrangement. One, Maung Po. O, had been appointed an
honorary head constable, and had hitherto maintained order
in the south-west corner of Pagyi, and Maung Tha Gyi, an
influential headman, held a similar position in the north-west
and had done well and had acted with loyalty. The
villages under Maung Tha Gyi, a group of small hamlets of
twenty to thirty houses each, lay in the thick scrub jungle
on the spurs of the Pondaung range.</p>

<p>A leader named Bo Sawbwa, who was acting in the
interests of the Shwègyobyu Prince and had fortified himself
in the jungles south of Pagyi, attacked and carried off
Po. O. At the same time Maung Tha Gyi suddenly threw
off his allegiance to the British, collected men, and fortified
a position near one of his villages. He was reported to
be ready to join the Shwègyobyu Prince, who ever since his
gang was dispersed in 1886 had been harboured by a circle
of villages in the west of Pagyi.</p>

<p>On receipt of this intelligence every precaution was taken.
Sir George White sent Colonel Symons to take command
of the military operations, and I selected Mr. Carter as the
best man to accompany him as a civil officer with magisterial
powers.</p>

<p>Captain Raikes was Deputy Commissioner of the Chindwin
district at the time. He was away on leave, and Mr.
W. T. Morison,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> of the Indian Civil Service, Bombay Presidency,
was acting for him and was at Alôn, the district
headquarters on the left bank of the Chindwin River. Mr.
W. T. Morison was a young officer of five or six years'
service and had been in Burma a very short time. He was
one of the young men, of whom there were not a few in
Burma, who took instinctively to the work.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of October he crossed over to the disturbed
tract and joined Lieutenant Plumer, who, with a detachment
of the 2nd Hyderabad Contingent Infantry, was at
Hlawga, a march west from the river.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Morison wrote at once to Maung Tha Gyi, ordering
him to come in. Tha Gyi, who was at one of his villages,
Chaungwa, about sixteen miles from Hlawga, sent an
evasive reply and began to collect men and arms.</p>

<p>Mr. Morison decided to try to surprise him. On the
morning of the 8th of October, Lieutenant Plumer and Mr.
Morison, with twenty-one Mounted Infantry, from the military
police battalion, and the Hyderabad Contingent, left
Hlawga soon after midnight, and surprised Chaungwa at
four o'clock in the morning, when it was still dark.</p>

<p>The village, when day broke, was found to be on the west
bank of a deep ravine, at the bottom of which was the only
cart-road. On the steep bank on which the village stood
strong fortifications and entrenchments, commanding this
cart-road, had been built; trees had been felled and thrown
across, and the road covered with bamboo spikes. Our men
were led by an excellent guide, who took them through the
jungle across the ravine and up to one of the enemy's
outposts.</p>

<p>Twenty-one men could not surround the village, but
they rushed it, killing one only and capturing six. The
leaders, who were found to have been the Bayingan and
Maung Tha Gyi, escaped. Nine ponies tied near the
house occupied by the former were taken, and in the
house were found twenty royal battle standards, many
arms, and much correspondence.</p>

<p>After a halt for rest, the main body, fifteen rifles with
the prisoners and captured ponies, were sent off. Lieutenant
Plumer and Mr. Morison, with a jemadar and six
mounted military policemen and a Burmese interpreter,
remained behind, hoping that some of the enemy would
return and fall into their hands. The Burmans, however,
were not so simple. After a short delay the two British
officers and their men set out to follow the main body.
The moment they reached the ravine a volley was fired
from the perpendicular bank opposite the village. Maung
Po Min, the interpreter, was shot in the leg, his pony killed,
and Mr. Morison's hand was grazed by a bullet. Mr.
Morison, who was well mounted, took Po Min up behind
him, and they all scrambled up the western bank of the
ravine, hoping to be able to see the dacoits and return
their fire. A few volleys were fired at random, as the
enemy could not be seen; and then, fearing further ambuscades,
the small party took a jungle track, hoping it would
lead round into the main road lower down. The village
of Chaungwa is on the spurs of a low range of hills. The
jungle is of the densest, and cut up in every direction by
deep ravines, and they had no guide. The track was
evidently taking them in a wrong direction. They resolved
to leave it and make as nearly due east as they could.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Outer bamboo stockade of Burmese frontier village.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<p>The rest of the story can best be told in Mr. Morison's
own words, taken from a letter to the Commissioner
of the Central Division, dated Camp Kyadet, the 13th of
October, 1887:&mdash;</p>

<p>"After about fifteen minutes the dacoits, who had followed
us, opened fire on us from about 50 yards in the front, they
being quite concealed. After one volley they would retire,
allow us to go forward 200 yards, then go round in front
and give us another volley. We had at each volley to
dismount and try and return their fire as best we could.
But from first to last the dacoits were invisible and under
complete cover, and, knowing the jungle, had time to go
ahead, lie in wait for us, and take aim. This continued
for over an hour. Our horses were completely done out
with going down and up the precipitous ravines, and the
ravines became at last quite impassable for horses. So
after a consultation we determined to leave our ponies and
make our way east on foot. Shortly after leaving the
ponies one of the men, Amir Mahomed, was shot dead in
the head from one of the usual ambuscades. That the
others of our party escaped appears a miracle to me.
However, after about two hours, <i>i.e.</i>, about 10 a.m., the
firing ceased, and we managed, exhausted as we were, to
get clear of the jungle by 2 p.m., going 200 yards at a time
and then lying down to rest. We arrived at Mintainbin at
4 p.m. and Hlawga at 6. Our loss was thus one man
killed and seven police ponies, with saddles and bridles,
left.... The men behaved well throughout the affair."</p>

<p>If the ponies had not been left there would have been
little chance of the men escaping from the jungle with
their lives.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the mass of the Bayingan's correspondence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
was in one of the saddle-bags abandoned with the
ponies. Some of the documents saved were copies of
notices to noted leaders in many districts of Upper Burma
and the Shan States. The following is a translation of one
of them:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I, the Bayingan Prince, brother of the Myingun
Prince, write to the Chief Bo Nyo U and other Chiefs in
Sagaing as follows. I have been to all Sawbwas, Bo
Gyôks (Chief Bos), and other Bos of the north, south, and
east, and have given orders and administered oaths which
they have taken; they have promised to serve loyally, and
we intend to drive the British from Kani and Pagyi and
take Alôn, Shwèbo, Dabayen, &amp;c., and go up to Mandalay
in month of Tazaungmôn."</p>

<p>Careful inquiries showed that Maung Ba, the Bayingan
Prince, arrived in Pagyi in the end of September and came
to Maung Tha Gyi. Since his arrival he had been corresponding
with the Shwègyobyu Prince and other Bos in
this part, and had actually sent over to Yaw for assistance.
He had friends in Alôn and elsewhere. A letter from Kin
Le Gyi (a maid-of-honour to Supayalat, who had since the
war taken contracts for public works in Monywa and elsewhere,
and had been trusted by the British officials) was
found in the Prince's house, saying that she was going up
to Alôn to see how the troops were disposed and what all the
officers were doing, and that she would write to him on her
return. This is very characteristic of the Burman woman.</p>

<p>On the 12th of October Morison was back at Kyadet,
in the south of Pagyi, where there was a military post,
and consulted with Major Kennedy, commanding the
2nd Hyderabad Contingent Infantry, who arrived with
a reinforcement of seventy rifles. They decided to telegraph
for more troops. This request had been anticipated.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Major Kennedy did not wait for the
reinforcements. Hearing that the Bayingan and Tha
Gyi had taken up a position at Chinbyit, about twenty
miles from Kyadet, he left with a few Mounted Infantry.
He was accompanied by Captain Beville, Assistant Commissioner,
who had been posted to the district to enable Mr.
Morison to return to his headquarters at Alôn. The rebels,
who were in strength and in a good position, stood, and both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Major Kennedy and Captain Beville were killed. The
rebels lost forty men, killed. The seventy rifles, under
Lieutenant Plumer (2nd Hyderabad Contingent Infantry),
came up in time to complete the defeat of the enemy.</p>

<p>It was reported at the time that the leaders had escaped.
Afterwards it was found that Maung Tha Gyi and the
Bayingan Prince had both been killed.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Nga Pyo, a
notorious rebel and dacoit leader, was present, but did not
expose himself, and lived until 1889, to be assassinated by a
colleague. Whether the Shwègyobyu Prince was there is
doubtful.</p>

<p>The action at Chinbyit cost us much. Lord Dufferin
wrote: "It is too distressing to think that so slight an
affair should have cost us the lives of two valuable officers."
Their lives were not thrown away. The loss inflicted
on the enemy was severe, and the death of the Bayingan
prince put an end to a troublesome organization.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

TROUBLE WITH THE WUNTHO SAWBWA</h2>


<p>I left Rangoon on the 30th of November, after
arranging the measures necessary for commencing the
disarmament of the province at the beginning of the new
year. There were two districts in Lower Burma giving
trouble at that time&mdash;Tharrawaddy in the Pegu Division
and Thayetmyo. Tharrawaddy has always been a sore
spot.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> In the early part of 1889 it was brought into a
more orderly state; but towards the end of the year,
owing in a great measure to the action of the local
officers in issuing licences for firearms to the villagers,
the gangs were able to obtain weapons, and crime increased
to such a degree that strenuous measures had to
be adopted.</p>

<p>I went to Thayetmyo, and there met the local officers
and heard what account they had to give. They reported
the remaining gangs to be small. Parties of Mounted
Infantry, with active police and civil officers, were told off
to work both sides of the river, and a great improvement
was effected in a few months.</p>

<p>I marched from Thayetmyo to Minhla, about seventy
miles, having all the neighbouring villagers collected to
meet me at each halting-place. They were encouraged to
talk freely and tell their grievances. They complained
only of the impressment of carts and such-like matters
inseparable from the constant movement of troops and
the disturbed times. That they had suffered a good deal
between the upper and the nether millstone&mdash;the Government
and the dacoits&mdash;may be easily believed. But it was
in great part their own fault, as they would not give our
officers information.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/i118.jpg" width="800" height="545" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Consultation of village headmen with Chief Commissioner.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<p>The country through which we marched was mostly
dense forest and jungle, with very few villages. It was
only necessary to see it to understand the difficulty of
beating out of such cover small gangs of active men, unencumbered
by anything except their arms, and able to
get food from any hamlet. The wonder is that with a
mere handful of Mounted Infantry at their disposal, our
officers were able to run the dacoits down and exterminate
them in so short a time.</p>

<p>Sir Benjamin Simpson, K.C.I.E., Surgeon-General, with
the Government of India, who had been sent over by
the Government to advise me about the medical establishments
of the military police and of the province generally,
accompanied me on this march.</p>

<p>From Minhla I went to Minbu and saw the officers there.
I then went on to Pagan. In order to see the country
about Popa, I rode from Pagan to Popa and back by
another road. This country is very wild and densely
wooded. It would seem to one riding through it to be
uncultivated, but this is not the case. All the bottoms of
the slopes are cultivated, and there are numerous shallow
streams which in the dry weather have no water in them.
The villages were few and poor-looking, mere huts with
palm-leaf thatch. The cattle, however, were numerous
and good, carts stood in all the villages.</p>

<p>Not a man was to be seen anywhere, only women and
children. We had lost our way and wanted a guide, and
eventually were fain to ask for two women to show us the
way. It is no wonder that Popa was the home of dacoits.
Most of the people seemed at this time to live by stealing
cattle from the neighbouring and more populous districts.
Once they got the cattle into their villages, they kept them
in enclosures, hidden away in the jungle, until they could
drive them off to a distant market. This country was
not brought under control for two years.</p>

<p>From Pagan I crossed to Pakokku and saw the Wunkadaw
and her son, and Mr. Browning the Assistant
Commissioner, and then went on to Myingyan. I had
only time to inspect the station and see the officers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
talk to Brigadier-General Low, when a telegram came from
Sir George White asking me to come up to Mandalay at
once, as trouble threatened with the Wuntho Sawbwa.</p>

<p>This man's territory lay in a hilly country lying between
the Katha district and the Chindwin River. He had been
from the first year of our occupation a source of trouble;
he refused to come in, and at one time objected to pay
his tribute. Early in '87 the Commissioner of the Northern
Division, Mr. Burgess, went to the town of Wuntho, which
is on the eastern extremity of his country, and is not his
real capital although he takes his title from it, to meet
him. Mr. Burgess was accompanied by a military force.
The matter was then arranged by the Sawbwa paying
his tribute, but he refused to see our officers, and continued
to give trouble by harbouring dacoits and insurgents who
raided our territory.</p>

<p>It was the fixed policy of Lord Dufferin to preserve
so far as might be these autonomous States. I have
explained elsewhere how it came about that Shan States
existed in this part of Burma, separated as they were by
position and in their politics from the body of States on the
Shan plateau. Every endeavour was made therefore to
smooth matters and not to quarrel with the Wuntho man,
whom we believed, and perhaps justly, to be actuated more
by fear than by determined hostility.</p>

<p>The circumstances which led Sir George White to call
me to Mandalay were these. A regiment of Gurkhas was
coming across from India to relieve another which had
been some time in Burma. It was convenient to bring the
relieving regiment down by the Kabaw Valley to the Chindwin,
where they would meet the other. A road had been
selected through the Wuntho territory by which both
regiments should march. They were to meet on the Chindwin
and exchange transport trains, thus saving expense and
trouble.</p>

<p>This was a natural arrangement. The route did not pass
through the Sawbwa's capital. The military authorities
had satisfied themselves that it was practicable for troops.
I agreed to the proposal, caused the matter to be carefully
explained to the Sawbwa, and directed him to collect supplies
and to clear the roads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>The Sawbwa replied, objecting to our troops passing
through, and proposing an alternative route to which he
had no objection. He based his opposition on the ground
of personal fear, and referred to our assurance that Wuntho
should not be occupied. I considered that we could not
allow the Sawbwa to close his territory to us, and after
consulting the Major-General, I told the Sawbwa through
the Deputy Commissioner of Katha that the regiments must
march by the road we had chosen. Rumours had been
heard for some time that the Sawbwa was blocking his
roads and preparing to oppose us in force. General White
wished me to come up at once as the regiment leaving
Burma had reached Kawlin, which is on the verge of
Wuntho territory, and it was necessary to decide on the
action to be taken in case its march was opposed. I decided
to let it wait at Kawlin for ten days in order to give the
Sawbwa time to reply to my order, utilising the delay by
making arrangements to support and strengthen the Gurkhas
in case we should have to fight. Soon after this decision
had been reached, Sir George White sent me a telegram from
the Colonel commanding the 43rd, dated from Kawlin, to
the effect that the route by which he had been ordered to
march was impracticable, and that the attempt to march
along it would be opposed. General White advised the
acceptance of the Sawbwa's alternative route, which was reported
to have been prepared and supplied with provisions.</p>

<p>As my order sent through the Deputy Commissioner had
been couched in very peremptory terms, I felt it inadvisable
to withdraw. The Sawbwa was reported to be making
preparations for opposing us by force, and if we drew back
now our action would be certainly attributed to fear.
There was telegraphic communication with Katha, but
letters to Wuntho had to go on by messenger. It occurred
to me that the Deputy Commissioner's messenger might
still be stopped, and I telegraphed to Katha to recall him.
Fortunately the letter was stopped at Kawlin. Under these
circumstances Sir George White and I agreed to send the
Gurkhas by the road which the Sawbwa had prepared. Any
other course would have laid us open to the charge of
having picked a quarrel with the Sawbwa.</p>

<p>There was every reason at the time for avoiding a step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
which would have increased our direct responsibilities. The
civil staff of the province was weak, not only in numbers
but in experience. I was forced to trust men with districts
who had no training and did not know Burmese. The
annexation of Upper Burma was more difficult in some
ways than the annexation of the Punjab. In the latter
case there was in the army and in the adjacent provinces
a supply of officers acquainted if not with the language of
the Punjab, yet with a kindred speech. The whole <i>cadre</i>
of Lower Burma was only threescore men, and it was
impossible to take many men fit for service in Upper Burma
from its ranks without leaving the Lower Province very
much undermanned. For these reasons I did my best as
long as I was in Burma to avoid a breach with the Wuntho
Sawbwa, and latterly, when he sent in his wife to Mandalay
to see the Commissioner, I was in hopes that we had overcome
his suspicions, but I felt certain that sooner or later we
should be obliged to get rid of him. I do not regret having
waited as long as possible. When he broke out in 1891
the whole of the adjacent country was under control, the
military police were organized and trained, and his revolt
was put down with very little trouble or disturbance. No
one can say that he was treated otherwise than with the
greatest forbearance. I shall not have to refer to him
again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

MILITARY REPLACED BY POLICE</h2>


<p>The beginning of 1888 saw the civil administration in a
position to wage a systematic campaign against all
disturbers of the peace.</p>

<p>Lower Burma had been reduced almost to its normal
condition. The late Mr. Todd Naylor in the Tharrawaddy
district had thoroughly extirpated the gangs which had
troubled it and brought it to a state of quiet which it had
not enjoyed for a very long time.</p>

<p>The disarmament of the whole province had been systematically
taken in hand; the Village Regulation had become
law, the military police had been organized and now numbered
17,880 men. The whole conditions had been changed.
At the beginning of the year (1887) the troops had held
one hundred and forty-two posts and the police fifty posts.
At the end of the year the police held one hundred and
seventy-five, and the troops eighty-four. The concentration
of the troops in a few principal stations, left the work of
destroying the remaining gangs to the military police, who
were frequently engaged in action with dacoits. There
were a few petty disasters at first. Nothing else was or
could have been expected of partially trained men scattered
about in small posts. There were only three serious cases
in 1888. In one case, in distinct contravention of my orders,
a small picket of ten men had been put out on the edge of
a forest in a small house or shed without even a bamboo
stockade. The picket was two miles from a military police
post. The Burmans set fire to a cooking shed and volleyed
the police by the aid of the firelight. Seven men fell to
the first two volleys and only two were unwounded. These
men behaved gallantly and kept the dacoits at bay until aid
came from the post.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>In another case and in another district a patrol of one
jemadar and eleven sepoys was ambushed. The jemadar
and nine of the men were killed and one man badly wounded
and left for dead. The remaining man with the aid of two
Burmans reached the nearest post. A party was sent out
and the wounded man picked up.</p>

<p>The third disaster was in the Magwè district, where thirty
men under an English Inspector met a large body of
dacoits and were forced to retreat losing seven killed and
two wounded. Six Snider rifles and two ponies were captured
by the dacoits. This was an unfortunate affair for
which the men were not responsible. It gave the Magwè
dacoits fresh spirit.</p>

<p>To the responsible head of the administration the year
1888 was one of much anxiety. The troops were vacating
numerous outposts held by them and they were being
replaced by police fresh from India, and most of them imperfectly
trained. The dacoits had learned to fear the
soldiers, and the presence of a large body of men with
numerous outlying detachments under military discipline
and keeping touch with each other, kept districts which
had all the elements of disorder and were perhaps
in fact dominated by dacoit leaders in apparent tranquillity.
Sagaing was a notable instance of this. The
district was covered with posts, but the soldiers hardly
saw a dacoit, and consequently no progress was made
in breaking up what was a strongly organized combination
against our rule.</p>

<p>The troops, moreover, had learned their work; they were
led by trained and zealous officers, who had acquired in
many cases a minute knowledge of localities which was
lost with them. The military police, on the other hand,
were new to the country and the work, and seldom had the
advantage of being led by trained British officers. The
effect of the change began to be felt towards the end
of 1887, and the beginning of 1888&mdash;that is to say, in the
season of the year when life in the forest is dry and
pleasant, the favourite time for the pastime of dacoity.
Hence there was no doubt a revival of disorder in some
places, and the petty disasters which befell the military
police were magnified and made much of by some correspondents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
who found it profitable to misrepresent everything
connected with the administration of Burma.</p>

<p>The transition stage did not last long. The Indian
police picked up their work with rapidity. No men could
have learnt it quicker. They were constantly engaged with
dacoits; they frequently followed up and inflicted punishment
on them and recovered property without loss to themselves.
The few mistakes were seized upon and magnified
while the successes vastly greater in number were not noticed.</p>

<p>In the first orders regarding the military police the minimum
garrison of a post was fixed at twenty-five men. This
was found to be too weak and was raised to forty, and the
minimum strength of a patrol was fixed at ten. I found
it necessary to forbid any new post to be established without
my sanction and to lay down the strength of the movable
column to be maintained in each district. The local
officers seemed unable to refrain from putting out posts
until there was not a man left at headquarters.</p>

<p>In April, 1888, the Viceroy asked me if I saw any sensible
signs of the reduction of our troops and the substitution
of the police encouraging the dacoits or loosening our
hold on the country. After explaining that the districts
where the dacoits were most active and organized there
had been no reduction of troops, but, on the contrary, constant
military activity under keen commanders, I wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have carefully watched events and thought over the
matter, and my conclusion is that the dacoits know that the
troops have retired and that the police move in small numbers
and have taken advantage of the occasion. If this is
allowed to go on they will get bolder and will give
trouble.... I am inclined to sit tight and wait until the men
have learnt their work. The native officers will learn the
language and the country.... The commissioners and
district officers like to cover their districts with a perfect network
of posts at short distances from each other. If they
were allowed their own way there would not be a man left
to move about. Last August (1887) this was foreseen, and
the strength of the movable column to be kept for active
operations in each district was laid down, and orders have
been given and have been enforced forbidding the formation
of new posts without my sanction."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Dufferin accepted my views, saying that he
would not go into the various considerations which I had
placed before him, "except to say that I fully appreciate
the calmness and good sense with which you have
discussed the matter. A more excitable man might
have gone off at a tangent and have been frightened into
measures which would certainly have been very expensive
and might not have been necessary. I have taken the
Commander-in-Chief into counsel, and after going fully
and very carefully into the whole matter we are content
to accept your views."</p>

<p>There was in point of fact no reason for anxiety. Week
by week the police improved. The first combined movement
attempted with military police was in the difficult
Popa country where four small columns under Captain
Hastings, Commandant of the Myingyan battalion, succeeded
in running Ya Nyun's gang hard, but did not capture
him. And in various encounters in this district alone
the dacoit gangs loss amounted to: killed, 105; wounded
and captured, 29; captured, 486. Eighteen ponies were
taken, 316 firearms, and many dahs and spears.</p>

<p>The casualties of the military police in Upper Burma,
during 1888, were 46 killed and 76 wounded, whilst the
dacoits lost 312 killed (actually counted after action), and
721 captured. The casualties in the Army in Upper Burma
between the 1st of May, 1887, and the 31st of March,
1889, were: killed or died of wounds 60, and wounded 142.
(Par. 26 of the Despatch of Major-General Sir George White,
K.C.B., V.C., late Commanding the Upper Burma Force.
Dated Simla, July 6, 1889.) The police could not have been
more active than the soldiers had been. They probably
suffered more in proportion to their numbers owing to
their inferior training. During the year 1888 the military
police were in the field constantly in almost every district
in the province.</p>

<p>It became evident that we had not a sufficient number
of British officers; if a man fell sick or was wounded,
there was no one to take his place. Sixteen additional
officers were sanctioned for the police, but they did not
arrive until after the close of the year. They added much
to the strength and efficiency of the force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>On the whole, it became evident before the middle of
1888 that the police were getting a hold of the province
and that no danger had been incurred by reducing the
military garrison and bringing the troops into quarters.
We had still to rely on the assistance of the soldiers in
work that belonged more properly to the police.</p>

<p>Hence in Sagaing, Magwè, the Chindwin district, and
some other places where the insurgents showed special
activity, I was compelled in some cases to ask for aid.
If it was sought unwillingly, it was given most readily
by the Major-General commanding, and was invaluable.
The civil administration was not yet able to stand alone.
It was not so much the rank and file but the many British
officers, keen and experienced, whose withdrawal was
felt; for it will be remembered each police battalion had
at the most two British officers, while very few districts
had an area of less than three thousand square miles.</p>

<p>As an example of the invaluable aid rendered by the
soldiers, two of the most noted leaders on the Ava side,
Shwè Yan and Bo Tok, who had been the scourge of
the country since the annexation, fell to parties of British
Infantry. Bo Tok was killed by Mounted Infantry of
the Rifle Brigade led by Major Sir Bartle Frere, and a
few months later, Lieutenant Minogue, with some Mounted
Infantry of the Royal Munster Fusiliers, ran down Shwè
Yan. The deaths of these two men, who kept the borders
of Ava, Myingyan, and Kyauksè in a ferment, enabled
the civil power to bring this country into order in a short
time.</p>

<p>The military police, however, took their full share of
work. A man who had given endless trouble to the troops
since the annexation and made his lair on the east side
of the Kyauksè district was the Setkya leader. He was
attacked by the Kyauksè military police under Captain
Gastrell, Commandant of the Mandalay battalion, and
his band dispersed. The Setkya escaped, but he was caught
and delivered up by the Shan Sawbwa of Lawksawk. After
his defeats on former occasions he had found a safe refuge
in the Shan hills. The Shan leaders were now our loyal
subjects, and the Setkya's career came to an end.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

BURMA BECOMES A FRONTIER PROVINCE</h2>


<p>In another direction there was a still greater change than
the substitution of police for troops. From being an
isolated administration hardly able to look up from our own
affairs, and obliged to work in detail, district by district, to
establish a beginning of order, Burma was rapidly becoming
a frontier province, with daily extending boundaries. I
was occupied in this year with framing the administration
of the Shan States, which had been visited by Mr. Hildebrand
and Mr. Hugh Daly,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> with our relations to Eastern
Karenni, with the Trans-Salween States and the Siamese
claims on that border. The distant region to the north of
Bhamo had been occupied for the first time, and it was
becoming evident that we should have to reckon with the
Kachins in the north and north-east; while the eastern
frontier of Upper Burma resting up against the great mass
of mountains which stretch down from Manipur to the Bay
of Bengal, was beginning to demand attention.</p>

<p>There had been hitherto no leisure and no need to give
much thought to the tribes of Chins and others inhabiting
these hills. It had been suggested at an early period that
Burma should send a party through the Chin country to
meet another from the Bengal side, with the design of opening
up communication from east to west and making a
through road.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>
<p>I was opposed to this project, and besought the Viceroy to
disallow it. I looked upon it as a certain way of rousing the
Chins before we were ready to deal with them. A few days
before the end of 1887 Lord Dufferin telegraphed his agreement
with my view. In a letter which followed, he wrote:
"When the idea was originally proposed, I allowed the
matter to be taken in hand with some hesitation, as I felt
that it would probably prove a premature endeavour, and I
saw no special reason for embarking on luxurious enterprises
of the kind while the main work on which we are engaged
is still incomplete. For God's sake let us get Burma proper
quiet before we stir up fresh chances of trouble and collision
in outlying districts."</p>

<p>Of the wisdom of this doctrine there was no doubt. And
no one could have been more anxious to avoid new difficulties
than I was. The Chins, however, forced our hands,
and before the rains of 1888 it was clear that it would be
impossible to ignore them. It was foreseen from the first
that the occupation of Upper Burma must bring us into
conflict with half-savage or altogether savage tribes who
occupied the mountains on three sides of the province; and
no doubt when it was decided to annex the kingdom the
responsible authorities had this matter in their minds.</p>

<p>From the first occupation of Mogaung the isolation of that
post and the difficulty of reinforcing it, especially in the
rains, was a source of disquiet. I had lost no time in asking
that some mountain guns should be attached to the Mogaung
battalion of military police, and that a survey for an extension
of the railway to the north of the province should be undertaken.
The guns were readily granted. To give life to the
railway project several departments in India had to be
persuaded, notably Finance and Public Works. When
their consent had been obtained the Government of India
had to move the Secretary of State to sanction the work
and to grant the money for it. The survey was started in
1890, and some progress, which may be characterized without
injustice as deliberate, had been made before I
surrendered Burma to my successor in December of that
year. The line to Myitkyina, three hundred and thirty-one
miles, was opened in 1895.</p>

<p>These frontier matters have been dealt with in separate
chapters of this book. They are referred to here to show
the change which had come over the province. The area<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of administration was extending rapidly&mdash;more rapidly than
our resources in men.</p>

<p>Before the end of 1888 the interior of the province ceased
to give much cause for anxiety, although it cannot be
described as altogether restful. Daylight had appeared in
the districts of the Northern and Central Divisions, where
the outlook had been darkest. And in some of the
southern districts, Minbu and Myingyan (in which was now
included Pagan), and in Pakokku, as well as in the whole of
the Eastern Division, the disturbances had ceased or were
confined to difficult forest tracks in which the remaining
gangs had taken refuge.</p>

<p>The Magwè district, as it was now called (the township
on the left bank of the river, which had before belonged to
Minbu, had been transferred to the Taungdwingyi district,
and the headquarters moved to the river town of Magwè),
was a source of trouble and sorrow. Nothing seemed to
succeed there. Sir Robert Low's warning that this would
be the last stronghold of dacoity or organized resistance was
justified by events.</p>

<p>The British public were becoming very weary of Burma
and even of the abuse heaped upon the local government of
the province. Tormented by the questions in Parliament,
the Secretary of State would order us every now and then to
report how we were getting on, like a child that has planted
a flower and pulls it up occasionally to make sure that
it is alive. Nevertheless those on the spot were not disheartened.
The work had to be done, and all were
determined to do it. Personally I had encouragement from
every one in the province, civilian or soldier, for whose
opinion I cared. Lord Dufferin's kindness and support
were never wanting. He understood well the nature of the
task. He was satisfied with the work done, and his confidence
in our success was firm.</p>

<p>Writing to me on April 2, 1888, he expressed his satisfaction
with our work and with what had been done, in
terms which are too flattering to be repeated by me.</p>

<p>The constant recurrence of small encounters, small successes,
and occasionally small disasters, was very wearisome
at the time to all of us, and would be as fatiguing to the
reader as to me to relate. I will give the history of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
cases, which will be enough to explain how the province
settled down. It will be remembered that the Village
Regulation became law in October, 1887. It took some
time to get the district officers, magistrates as well as
police, to make themselves acquainted with it, and still
longer to induce some of them to make use of its provisions.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1888 the country generally had improved
much. Few of the big Bos, or leaders of gangs,
were left. But in some districts there was not merely a
system of brigandage; it was a system, a long-established
system, of government by brigands. The attacks on
villages, the murder and torture of headmen and their
families, were not so much the symptoms of rebellion
against our Government as of the efforts made by the
brigands to crush the growing revolt against their tyranny.</p>

<p>Hence it came about that in districts where there was
little activity on the part of British officers, and where
the chief civil officer failed to get information, very little
was heard of the dacoits, simply because the people were
paying their tribute to the leaders, who did not need to use
coercion.</p>

<p>Sagaing was one of the worst districts in this respect. It
had been under the domination of brigands for years before
Thebaw was dethroned. It was held by a score of dacoit
leaders, who had a thousand men armed with guns at their
call. Each had his own division, in and on which he and
his men lived, leaving the villagers alone so long as they
paid their dues, and punishing default or defection with
a ruthless and savage cruelty that might have made a
North American Indian in his worst time weep for human
nature. It was brought home to us by hard facts that
the question was whether the British Government, or what
may be called the Bo Government, were to be masters.
The people were, everything considered, wonderfully well
off. They found our officers ready to accept their excuses
and to remit taxation, or, at the worst, to enforce a mild
process of distraint or detention against defaulters. On
the other side were the Bos, with fire and sword, and
worse if their demands were refused or if aid in any form
was given to the foreigners. If the people would have
given us information, the dacoit system could have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
broken up in a very short time. As they would not, the
only course open was to make them fear us more than
the dacoits.</p>

<p>In Sagaing no measures hitherto taken had made any
visible improvement. Persuasion had been tried. The
display of a strong military force occupying the country
in numerous posts had no effect. The soldiers seldom
saw or heard of a dacoit. The experiment was made of
allowing influential local Burman officials to raise a force
of armed Burman police on whom they could depend. This
succeeded in some cases. But on the whole it failed. The
Burmans gave up their guns to the first gang that came
for them, or allowed them to be stolen. We could not
afford to arm the enemy. I came to the conclusion that
the Deputy Commissioner would never get his district into
order.</p>

<p>Colonel Symons, working with Mr. Carter, had done very
good service in reducing the troublesome country of Pagyi
in the Lower Chindwin into order (see p. 85). I asked
Sir George White to let me have Colonel Symons's help
again. He readily agreed. I sent him, with Mr. Carter,
to put Sagaing in order, giving Mr. Carter full powers
under the Village Regulation and ample magisterial powers,
but reserving the ordinary administrative work to the
Deputy Commissioner. At the same time, Mr. Herbert
Browning, Assistant Commissioner, was posted to the Ava
subdivision to work with Captain Knox, of the 4th
Hyderabad Cavalry.</p>

<p>The Sagaing military police battalion was placed under
Colonel Symons's orders, and thus unity of command was
assured.</p>

<p>Captain Raikes was at this time acting as Commissioner
of the Central Division, in the absence of Mr. Fryer, who
had taken leave. Captain Raikes was a man who knew
Burma well, and was keen and energetic in his work.
He came to the conclusion, and Colonel Symons agreed
with him, that the severest pressure must be put on the
villagers.</p>

<p>A great obstacle in our way was, as has been said, the
refusal of the villagers to assist us. But an equal obstacle
was their zeal in giving assistance and information to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
brigands. The powers of the Village Regulation had been
used elsewhere, under my instructions, to remove persons
who gave assistance in any way to the dacoits, and with
excellent effect. The proposals now made to me by Colonel
Symons and Captain Raikes went beyond anything hitherto
done. They represented that so long as the relatives and
sympathisers of the brigands remained in their villages, no
progress was possible. The gangs would be fed and furnished
with immediate news of the movements of police
or troops, while no assistance would be given to us. The
people themselves told our officers that they could not help
us. If they did, the dacoits' relatives informed against them
and their lives were taken. Hardly a day passed without
some murder of this kind.</p>

<p>It was proposed, therefore, to issue a proclamation to all
villages believed to be in league with the dacoits, informing
them that unless the men belonging to the village who were
out dacoiting surrendered within a fixed time, all their relations
and sympathisers would be ordered to leave the village
and would be removed to some distant place out of reach of
communication. At first the people thought this was a
mere threat, and little notice was taken of it. When they
found that it was to be enforced, and that the relations and
friends were actually being deported, the effect was magical.
Concurrently with this action the dacoit gangs were hunted
incessantly from jungle to jungle and village to village, and
severe fines were imposed on villages which harboured the
outlaws or withheld information regarding their movements.</p>

<p>The results were better than I had dared to hope. Many
dacoits surrendered in order to save their people from being
removed. The villagers came forward with information, and
put police and soldiers on to the tracks of the gangs. Small
parties of dacoits could no longer move about without
danger of being attacked and captured by the people they
had preyed upon so long. Whole bodies of men came in
and surrendered with their arms. At the end of 1888 few
members of the Sagaing gangs were at large, and the
district was reduced to order. In Ava the success was
similar; and the districts of Yeu Shwèbo and the Lower
Chindwin had likewise benefited from Colonel Symons's
labours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The credit of devising this system is due to Colonel
Raikes. I hesitated at first to go as far as he advised.
There were obvious reasons against moving people in this
manner; but, if it was easy to see objections to it, it was
very difficult to devise a milder measure that would be
successful. It proved the most effective weapon in our
battery for the restoration of peace and order. The people,
of course, felt the pressure of these coercive measures. It
was intended that they should feel it. One of the most
notorious leaders in the Sagaing Division, Min O, after
his capture, declared the fining under the Village Regulation
had ruined him, because the villagers, finding themselves
unable to meet both the Government demands and his, and
finding that the Government could enforce payment while
he no longer could, turned upon him and refused to give
him asylum. The moving and grouping of villages made
it difficult for the gangs to get food, and compelled them
to disband or surrender.</p>

<p>The <i>Gazetteer of Burma</i>, in the article on Sagaing (vol. ii.,
p. 188), published in 1908, records that "the strict observance
of the Village Regulation ... gradually led to the
pacification of the country. By the end of 1888 no less
than twenty-six dacoit leaders, including Shwè Yan, had
been killed and twenty-six captured, and most of their
followers had come in and were disarmed. Since that time
the district has given no trouble."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

DACOITY IN THE MINBU AND MYINGYAN DISTRICTS</h2>


<p>The disorder in the Minbu district was similar to that
in Sagaing, but I doubt if it had been of such long
standing.</p>

<p>It differed in other respects from Sagaing. In that district
the Bos formed a confederation. Each had his own
village or district, from which he drew his supplies, and
his exclusive rights which the others recognized. They
communicated with each other and were ready to join forces
when it was necessary. In Minbu the government was
more autocratic, and centralized in the hands of Ôktama,
who had seven or eight lieutenants under his orders. There
was also another point of difference. The leaders in
Sagaing and generally elsewhere, were local men, and for
the most part professional robbers. Ôktama had been
a Pongyi some years before, in a monastery a few miles
north-west of Minbu. He professed to have a commission
from some obscure prince, but laid no claim to royal blood.</p>

<p>He made his first appearance in Minbu in February, 1886,
and induced the headmen of many villages to join him.</p>

<p>The people at this time were like sheep without a shepherd.
They had heard of the destruction of the wolf they
knew, and to whose ways they had become accustomed. Of
the new-comers, the <i>Kalas</i>, or barbarians, they had had no
experience, and they had as yet no reason to believe in their
power to protect them. Naturally, therefore, they looked
about for some one to help them to work together in their
own defence.</p>

<p>Ôktama no doubt had a capacity for organization and
command, and the people recognized him as a leader of
men; otherwise it is difficult to conceive how in so short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
a time he secured their allegiance. His attack on Sagu,
a town on the right bank of the Irrawaddy nearly opposite
Magwè, has been mentioned before. He burnt the town,
which was held by a handful of troops, and then laid siege
to Salin with a force said to have numbered five thousand
men. The deaths of the two British officers in action
against him increased his prestige, and from that time
until a few weeks before his capture on the 20th of July,
1889, he was at the head of a large confederacy which had
more power in Minbu than the British.</p>

<p>Ôktama assumed the title of Commissioner (Mingyi), and
created a regular system of government. He had five
lieutenants under him, to whom defined portions of the
country were entrusted. His intelligence department was
perfect. If the British troops showed a sign of movement,
warning was sent from village to village and reached
Ôktama in time for him to shift his camp. The organization
was very strong. It could not have lived and grown as
it did if my officers in Minbu had not been weak, and
their rule "placidius quam feroci provincia dignum." They
were not of the stuff that can bring a turbulent people
to submission.</p>

<p>When I was at Minbu, in the early part of the year,
I wished to march through the district and speak to
the people. Both the Commissioner and the Brigadier-General,
Sir Robert Low, strongly opposed my wish, as
they thought it likely that my party would be fired on, the
effect of which would be bad. However, I gave my
instructions regarding the measures to be taken.</p>

<p>In the June following I rode through the valley of the
Môn. The country seemed to me prosperous and well
cultivated; betel-vine gardens and plantations of bananas
were frequent near the villages, and I saw no sign of
distress or armed disorder.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the people were even then under the feet
of the dacoits. I changed the district officials as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>The improvement of the district dated from the appointment
as Deputy Commissioner of Mr. H. S. Hartnoll, who
brought to the work the necessary energy, activity, and
judgment. He was assisted by Mr. G. G. Collins and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Mr. W. A. Hertz, who were as zealous and active as their
chief. In May, 1888, being assured that the people were
getting weary of the brigands, I issued a proclamation
offering a free pardon to all the rank and file on condition
that they surrendered and engaged to live peaceably in their
villages. The leaders, eight in number, were excepted by
name. They were to be pursued until they were captured
or killed.</p>

<p>As two years and a half had elapsed since the annexation,
the fact that Burma was part of the British Empire must
have penetrated to the most remote village. Warning,
therefore, was given that the full rigour of the law would
be enforced against all who were taken fighting against
the Government, or who aided or abetted the leaders
excepted from pardon. The terms of this proclamation
were explained to the headmen and villagers assembled
at suitable places, and the severe penalties that would
follow disobedience were explained to them. A period of
one month was allowed for surrenders, and the pursuit of
the gangs was pressed unceasingly all through the rains
and open season of 1888-9.</p>

<p>The sequel I will give in Mr. Hartnoll's words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"His [Ôktama's] power had gradually grown less and
less from time to time, but the difficulty has always been
to get information of him and his leaders. The villagers
would give no aid or information. They began to turn
at the beginning of this year (1889) when certain fines
were imposed on the worst of the villages, yet they did
not give us all the help they could. In April, though his
power was much broken and many of his lieutenants killed
and captured, yet he had a fairly strong gathering; and
Maung Ya Baw, Maung Kan Thi, Ôktaya, Nga Kin, and
Byaing Gyi were still to the fore.</p>

<p>"From May 1st the relations of dacoits were removed from
their villages and a fortnightly fine imposed on all harbouring
villages. On this the villagers gave him up. He and
all his principal men except Maung Kin are dead or
captured. He had at the end only one boy with him....</p>

<p>"Our success has been entirely achieved by bringing
the villagers to our side by imposing a periodical general
fine on them until they helped us, by removing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
relations and sympathizers of the dacoits, by holding
certain points fairly close together throughout the district
till the leader troubling the point held was caught, and
by having constant parties of troops and police always on
the move."</p>

<p>The capture of Ôktama was effected in this wise. Maung
An Taw Ni, an Upper Burman, the township officer of
Legaing, a little town with a population of about three
thousand people, some fifteen miles north-west of Minbu,
received information that the dacoit chief was near the
Chaungdawya Pagoda, a short way from Legaing. Maung
An Taw Ni, who had borne a very active part in all the
measures taken against the dacoits, started at once with
some military police. They came upon Ôktama sitting
despairingly by the pagoda with only one follower. It
was a tragic picture. When Burmans shall paint historical
scenes for the galleries at Rangoon or Mandalay, or write
on the events following the fall of their king, "Ôktama
at the Golden Pagoda" will be a favourite theme for
ballad or drama (<i>pyazat</i>).</p>

<p>Another example of dacoity in Upper Burma may be
taken from the Myingyan district. I will give the case of
Ya Nyun, which gained some notoriety at the time. It
is remarkable also for the fact that Ya Nyun is probably
the last great leader who is still alive. And that he
owes his life to the extraordinary conduct of some very
subordinate officials, who, in the loyal desire, it may be
supposed, to secure his apprehension, took upon themselves
to induce him by vague words to hope for his life if he
surrendered. It is certain that no man in Burma ever
deserved to be hung more than Ya Nyun. If the voice
of the blood of the murdered cries from the ground, the
cries for vengeance must still be echoing through the
villages and woods round Popa.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Burmese Dacoits before trial&mdash;worst characters and native police

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>
<p>Ya Nyun was the Myingaung (literally Captain of the
Horse) of the Welaung sub-district of Myingyan, bound
at call to furnish one hundred mounted men to the king's
army. He had thirty headmen of villages under him.
His father, who had been Myingaung before him, was a
murderer and a scoundrel. He had been dismissed by
King Mindon's Government and tattooed as a bad character
with the Burmese words meaning: "Beware, cease to do
evil," on his forearm.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The son, however, was at Court
a hanger-on of the Yaw Mingyi, one of the big ministers.
He obtained his father's post. He returned to Welaung
and kept a large following of thieves and robbers, and
lived on the people.</p>

<p>His oppression became intolerable, and two years before
the war a deputation of the Thugyis (village headmen)
went up to Mandalay to beg protection, but as the Taingda
Mingyi, the most powerful and the worst man about the
Court, took Ya Nyun's part, they could get no redress. Two
years afterwards a second deputation was sent, and Ya
Nyun was summoned to Mandalay. The matter was under
inquiry when the British advance became known. Thereupon
Ya Nyun was decorated with a gold umbrella
(equivalent to a K.C.B.) and sent back to Welaung to
fight against the British. So far his case resembles, to
some extent, that of Bo Swè, who was, however, a gallant
gentleman and an honest citizen beside Ya Nyun.</p>

<p>His first step was to gather around him his former followers,
and he started with about fifty ruffians as the leaders and
stiffening of his gang. They had to live, and his methods
were the same as those of other dacoit leaders. Money and
food and women were demanded from the villages, and
those who refused supplies were unmercifully punished,
their property seized, their villages burnt, their women
dishonoured, and their cattle driven off by hundreds.
Those who in any way assisted the troops were the objects
of special barbarities. If they could not be caught, their
fathers or brothers were taken. One of his followers
deposed that he was with Ya Nyun when three men who
were related to a man who had assisted the British were
ordered to be crucified in front of the camp. He says: "I
saw the bodies after they were crucified.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> They were
crucified alive and then shot, their hearts cut open," &amp;c.
In another case "five men were caught. Nga Kè [one
of Ya Nyun's men] rode over them as they lay bound, and
then shot them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>An Indian washerman, belonging, if I remember right,
to the Rifle Brigade, straggled from a column on the march.
This same witness, who acted as a clerk or secretary on
Ya Nyun's staff, kept a diary and wrote letters and orders,
goes on: "Ya Nyun ordered Aung Bet to cut a piece out
of the Indian's thigh, morning and evening, and give it
to him to eat. The flesh was fried. This was done three
days. Six pieces were cut out, then Ya Nyun ordered him to
be killed. He was killed. I saw all this with my own eyes."</p>

<p>The ill-treatment of women by these gangs was not
unknown. Sometimes they were taken and ill-treated as
a punishment to the village which had set at naught
the Bo's order. Sometimes they were taken as concubines
for Ya Nyun and his comrades. There is one case on
record where seven young girls were selected from a village
"on account of their youth," and after the dacoits had
ill-used them, five were deliberately slaughtered for fear
of their giving information. Two escaped. This occurred
in January, 1890. The remains of the five girls were found
in the jungle afterwards by our men.</p>

<p>The Deputy Commissioner, who examined 136 witnesses
as to the doings of Ya Nyun's gang, concluded his inquiry
in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A perusal of the evidence shows that the organization,
which had, perhaps, its first origin in a desire to resist
the British Government, degenerated rapidly, as might have
been expected from the disreputable persons who played
the part of leaders, into a band of marauders who subsisted
by terrorism, rapine, murder, dacoity, and other outrages.
While remaining in open defiance of Government, they
soon ceased to be political rebels, in any respectable sense,
though they occasionally gathered in sufficient numbers
to resist the troops or police, even so late as February, 1889.
They showed no more mercy to their own countrymen
than to foreigners. They can have no claim to the title of
patriots, but merely to that of <i>damya</i>, dacoit, the title
invariably applied to them by their own countrymen."</p>

<p>So wrote the Deputy Commissioner who made the
inquiry in 1890. Ya Nyun has been in the Andamans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
ever since. I have been told that he has shown there
a capacity for command, and is in charge of a gang of
convicts. Then by all means let him stay where he is
useful and harmless.</p>

<p>I have given the history of Ya Nyun's rise to power
and some indications of the nature of his gang. In 1887
to 1888 it was frequently encountered by troops and police,
and was more than once roughly treated, but the wilderness
around Popa afforded a shelter from which the small
and scattered parties of dacoits could not be driven.</p>

<p>In March and April, 1888, a series of combined operations
was organized. Four columns of military police acted under
Captain Hastings, Commandant of the Myingyan battalion.
Several of Ya Nyun's men<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> were killed and many captured.</p>

<p>In the autumn murders, accompanied in some cases
with atrocious cruelties, began again. Early in 1889 Ya
Nyun, collecting several other leaders, mustered a strong
force, and occupied a position near his own village of
Welaung. A body of military police failed to dislodge
him, and although the gang was met soon after by a party
of the Rifle Brigade, and dispersed with heavy loss, the
power of the organization was not destroyed.</p>

<p>After these events an experienced officer, with powers
extending to all the country in which Ya Nyun and his
accomplices acted, was given control of the operations
against the brigands. At his suggestion a pardon was
offered to Ya Nyun if he would surrender. I consented
with much reluctance, but it seemed better to free the
country from misery at any price. The man would not
avail himself of it. Throughout the rains he and his men
were more active than usual, and their raids were marked
by more wanton cruelty and bloodshed than before; a
symptom, as I have said before, that the people were becoming
less submissive to the dacoits, who on their part were
striving to retain their hold on them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<p>As little substantial progress was being made, I went to
the Popa subdivision in January, 1890. I called up an
additional police force and saw that the utmost pressure
was put, under the Village Regulation, upon the villages
which harboured and assisted the dacoits. Some success
against the smaller leaders followed, but at the end of
April all the greater men, ten in number, for whose capture
rewards had been offered, were still at large.</p>

<p>In the middle of April the Commissioner, Mr Symes
(the late Sir E. Symes), advised that the time had come
for adopting the procedure followed so successfully in
Sagaing, Minbu, and elsewhere. This was done. Proclamations
were issued much in the same terms as those used
in other districts, offering pardon to the rank and file, and
warning all concerned that villages assisting the gangs
would be severely fined, and that sympathizers and relatives
would be deported to a distance. The rewards offered for
the capture of the leaders were doubled.</p>

<p>The success was extraordinary. The whole dacoit organization
fell to pieces. It collapsed as a tiger shot in the
head falls in his tracks. On the 30th of May, 1890, Ya
Nyun surrendered. Eleven of his lieutenants or comrades
had fallen in action, and forty-two men of note surrendered
with him.</p>

<p>One very influential leader of the bands in the Myingyan
district, whose name was well known in the years preceding,
was not caught. Bo Cho had not shown himself since
1888, and was reported to have disappeared. He lay low
until 1896, when he managed to get together some men
and began his old game. But in 1896 the Government
knew what to do and did it. An officer with sufficient
military police was at once appointed and empowered to
take action against him, the provisions of the Village
Regulation were put into effect, and in a few days he
was a prisoner. He was not given an opportunity for
further mischief.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

TROUBLE IN THE MAGWÈ DISTRICT</h2>


<p>I have alluded several times to the Magwè district. It
was in a very bad state and was a blot on the administration,
which gave me much thought. This district was
called Taungdwingyi at first, and took the name of Magwè
when the subdivision of that name lying along the left
of the river was added to it. It was not until the end
of 1888 that it began to be very troublesome. The leader
of most influence at first was Min Yaung, who was killed
by a party of troops in May, 1887. Another leader, Tokgyi,
rose afterwards and gave much trouble, but he was captured
in April, 1888. It seemed that no formidable leaders remained.
Small raids and dacoities occurred here, as in
most parts of the province, at that time. The revenue
collections had increased largely, which was a good sign.</p>

<p>In August, 1888, however, a pretender with the title of the
Shwèkinyo Prince raised his standard, and was joined by
a noted dacoit Bo Lè and others. They hatched their plots
in a place on the border of the Magwè township, and began
work in November, 1888. Unfortunately, everything in this
district was unfortunate, at the very commencement the
gang under Bo Lè encountered a party of thirty mounted
men of the Magwè battalion, under a British Inspector of
Police. The police were badly handled, and lost seven
killed and two wounded, while six rifles and three ponies
were taken by the dacoits. This gave the gang encouragement,
while the police, who had not much cohesion, were
for a time somewhat shaken. [See p. 96.]</p>

<p>After this event the gangs separated, probably because
the country could not feed them, and took up points at a
distance from each other. In January, 1889, some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
leaders joining hands again, surprised a party of the Myingyan
police, and inflicted some loss on them, but were soon
afterwards punished by Mounted Infantry from Magwè.</p>

<p>Throughout March and April, the pursuit was kept up
with varying success. At last in May, the Mounted
Infantry got on to their tracks, killed Bo Lè, and dispersed
the gang.</p>

<p>Hitherto the brigands had confined themselves to the
west and north-west of the district, open dry country
with a good deal of waste land offering a good field for
the action of mounted troops.</p>

<p>After a time the Taungdwingyi subdivision also became
disturbed, and dacoities became frequent. The conditions
on the eastern side of the district were different. The
hills known as the Pegu Yomas run along the eastern
boundary dividing Magwè from Pyinmana for about sixty
or seventy miles; from the Thayetmyo boundary on the
south, to some distance beyond Natmauk on the north.
From Natmauk the hills gradually diminish and slope
away to the plains. The slopes of the Yomas are
densely wooded, and between the Magwè boundary and
the low country to the east there was much teak forest
worked by the Bombay Burma Company. At that time there
was also a good growth of the Acacia Catechu, and many
of the Burmans employed in extracting cutch lived in the
forests, and cultivated small cleared plots here and there.
The richest villages and best rice-producing land in the
district lay along the low lands at the foot of the Yomas,
within raiding distance. No dacoit could have wished
for better conditions, especially when an inefficient
district officer and a poorly commanded police battalion
were added.</p>

<p>At this period of the campaign I had lost by sickness
and death some of the best and most experienced men.
The strength of the Commission all told was not enough
for the necessities of the province in its then state. I was
compelled to place districts in charge of men who were
unfit owing to inexperience and want of training.</p>

<p>It is a fact of which we may all be proud that the
average young English gentleman when thrown into
conditions which demand from him courage, energy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
judgment, and the power of governing, answers to the
call. Whether he comes from a good school or university,
or from his regiment, from the sea or the ranch, whether
he has come through the competitive system or has
obtained his appointment by other means, he will in the
majority of cases be found capable, and sometimes
conspicuously able. It is necessary, however, that he should
be taught and trained in his work. The Magwè district
was in itself not specially hard to manage, not nearly so
difficult as many others in Upper Burma. It was in
charge of a junior man of the Indian Civil Service,
clever but not very wise.</p>

<p>As it was necessary to take special measures against
the Yoma gangs, an officer, who had been ten years in
the police in Lower Burma and had done excellently in
the adjacent district of Thayetmyo, was appointed to
work on similar lines in Taungdwingyi.</p>

<p>He was in this matter independent of the Deputy
Commissioner, who, although senior to him in the
Commission, was much his junior in years and experience.
One of the chief duties assigned to him was the removal
of villages from which dacoits received their supplies. He
removed those lying nearest the hills which harboured
the brigands. No doubt the gangs were inconvenienced
and exasperated by this measure. In April, 1889, the
village of Myothit was attacked and the police post burnt.
In May a large body of dacoits under the standard of
Buddha Yaza, a pretended prince, who in preceding years
had a large following in the Eastern Division, gathered
in the Pin township in the north of the district east of
Yénangyaung. A party of military police led by two
Indian officers attacked them successfully, but they
collected again in a stronger position and a second
attack by one hundred rifles (military police), led by the
Assistant Commissioner and the Assistant Superintendent of
Police, neither of them trained soldiers, failed; but soon
afterwards the gangs were again met and dispersed.</p>

<p>On the 1st of June, 1889, a small body of dacoits was
encountered by Mr. Dyson, Assistant Commissioner, who
had with him a party of police. A fight ensued, in which
Mr. Dyson was killed. The man who led this gang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
was killed afterwards and his followers surrendered. But
this was no compensation for the loss of a promising
young officer who could be ill spared.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>There was a force of police in the district quite able to
hold it, if they had been properly handled, and they were
supported by Mounted Infantry. There was evidently a
want of some controlling authority which was not to be
found in any of the local officers. Just at this time Colonel
W. Penn Symons, who had been working in Sagaing, succeeded
to the command of the Myingyan district, and at
my earnest invitation he went to Magwè and assumed
control over the operations for reducing the district to
order. All civil and police officers were placed under
General Symons absolutely so far as the operations were
concerned.</p>

<p>A proclamation was then issued offering a pardon to all
who were out, excepting only those who had committed
murder and certain named leaders, on condition that they
submitted and returned to a peaceful life. This proclamation
had some effect, and more than 150 dacoits surrendered
with their arms. Most of the men who came in belonged
to the Pin and Yénangyaung townships.</p>

<p>In July (1889) I was able to devote a fortnight to this
troublesome district and to meet General Symons at
Magwè. With him and some of the local officials I marched
round the district, going from Magwè to Taungdwingyi, and
then up the east to the north, ending at Yénangyaung on
the north-west.</p>

<p>I found the country in a better condition than the reports
of crime had led me to expect. Going north from Taungdwingyi
a good deal of land was lying untilled. But elsewhere
every possible field was ploughed and sown, and
cattle were plentiful and in good case. This part of the
district was a fine open country divided into big fields with
thorn hedges. There were, however, here and there tracts
of very difficult scrub jungle broken by ravines from which
it would be difficult to drive dacoit gangs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<p>I had the principal men collected to meet me at all the
halting-places and had much consultation with them. The
people came readily with their petitions and spoke with
perfect frankness of their grievances.</p>

<p>As a problem in administration the conditions differed
much from those hitherto dealt with. In Sagaing, Minbu,
and elsewhere, the lawlessness was universal and chronic.
In Magwè the gangs were small and consisted mainly of
professional criminals, not of peasants who had joined
well-known leaders either to save their own lives and
property or to resist the establishment of a foreign Government.
Some of the leaders even were well-known outlaws
from Lower Burma, and it was asserted that there were
natives of India with the gangs. But only in one case was
this substantiated. A native of India, a man of the sweeper
caste, had been captured and he was in the Magwè jail. A
note written a few days after I had left Magwè will give
the impressions I brought away from my tour.</p>

<p>"The two main difficulties are the bad state of the
Police Battalion and the nature of the country on the north
and on the east of the district. These were aggravated by
the injudicious action on the part of the subdivisional
officer, for which I must take my share of the blame as I
selected him and trusted him fully in consequence of his
great success elsewhere. In his desire to force the dacoits
to leave the slopes of the mountains, he moved villages too
far from their fields and did not show a proper care and
judgment in selecting the temporary sites for them to
occupy. It was said that men joined the dacoit gangs in
consequence. It may have been so in a few instances.
The people spoke to me frankly and freely, and they did
not allege this. Still, it may be true. I debated much
with myself whether I should say, 'Go back at once to your
old sites.' This would have pleased all.... All the
headmen I saw admitted that the villages moved were
those which added and fed the dacoits, and they admitted
unreservedly that if they returned they must continue to
aid and feed them. General Symons was of opinion that
the removal of these villages would prove of the greatest
assistance in capturing the gangs. The mischief for that
season had been caused and some of the more distant lands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
must lie empty. To let the people return now (July) was
useless, while it would prolong our work.</p>

<p>"Their argument was, 'There are fewer dacoits now
than there used to be even in the King's time. We prefer
dacoits to inconvenience and hardship.'"</p>

<p>That was their attitude everywhere, and if peace was to
be established we could not accept it. I removed the
incompetent officers and sent the best officer I had at my
disposal (the late Mr. Todd Naylor) to take charge of the
district. At the same time a competent Commandant was
posted to the military police battalion.</p>

<p>General Symons undertook to remain in the district for
another month. Minbu had been cleared of the gangs
which had harassed it so long, and I was able to transfer
Mr. G. G. Collins to Magwè to help Mr. Todd Naylor.</p>

<p>Having put matters in train, my duties took me to Mandalay
and then up the Chindwin to arrange matters connected
with the coming expedition against the Chins.
General Symons was appointed to command the Chin-Lushai
expedition, and Magwè had to be left to the local
officers. Progress was slow. The dacoits lay up in the
forests of the Yomas, and until they were driven out and
destroyed there would be no peace.</p>

<p>For the last three months of the year my health compelled
me to take leave to the Nilgiri Hills. There was no
hill station in Burma at that time. The climate varying
between a stokehole and a fern-house was not invigorating,
and labour, physical and mental, such as we were all sustaining
was somewhat exhausting.</p>

<p>During my absence Mr. A. P. MacDonnell,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Home
Secretary to the Government of India, was appointed to
act for me. He took up the Magwè business vigorously,
and under his direction several columns were organized to
operate simultaneously in the unsettled tract from Yamèthin,
Pyinmana, Magwè, and Thayetmyo. They commenced
work in December, 1889. The party from Magwè
encountered one of the gangs in the Yomas, but inflicted
no punishment on them. One leader was driven out and
captured or killed in the Yamèthin district. But there was
no marked success. The dacoits were able to get food
anywhere in the forests from the cutch boilers, and it was
suspected ammunition from the Burman foresters in the
Bombay Burma Company's service.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<p>On my return, from leave in December 1889, I had the
great honour of receiving His Royal Highness Prince
Albert Victor of Wales, accompanying him to Mandalay
by rail and returning by river. This duty necessarily delayed
the ordinary work of administration.</p>

<p>On examining the situation in Magwè, I came to the
conclusion that the operations in the Yomas must be placed
under the control of one man. I selected Mr. Porter,
Deputy Commissioner of Pyinmana, and made the whole
business over to him with definite instructions as to the
powers he was to exercise and the course of action he was
to follow. Tracks had already been cleared through the
Yomas. The different parties engaged in the work were
well combined and held together by Mr. Porter. The gangs
were dispersed and either captured or forced to surrender,
and by the end of May the work was complete.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the north of the district Mr. Todd Naylor
and Mr. Collins had succeeded in breaking up the small
gang that still held out under two noted leaders, and the
district was finally cleared. All the leaders had been
killed, captured, or driven out of the district. Some sought
refuge in Lower Burma. One Lugalégyi, a well-known
Bo, was arrested in Prome before the end of the year.
To quote once more from the <i>Gazetteer</i> (1908): "Since
then Magwè has been undisturbed" (vol ii., p. 56,
article "Magwè").</p>

<p>I will give one more instance of dacoit methods reported
to me by the late Mr. Donald Smeaton, then Commissioner
of the Central Division, dated August 13, 1889, from the
Pagyi country. Reading it over after the lapse of more than
twenty years, I am glad that I was able to help in ending
the anarchy which begat such crimes. Mr. Smeaton wrote:
"Early in the forenoon of the 18th July I was riding
back with Lieutenant Macnabb from Kyaw to Zeittaung.
We were passing the village of Jut about four miles from
Zeittaung, when we were hailed by a villager and a military
policeman, who informed us that the village had just been
dacoited by Saga and a gang of fourteen or fifteen men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
We at once went into the village and were conducted
by the Thugyi to the house which had been Saga's principal
object of attack. We were there informed that this house
had been singled out by Saga because its owner, Po Hkine,
one of his late followers, had surrendered with his arms to
the special officer, that Saga's object had been to kill
Po Hkine. Fortunately Po Hkine and his wife were
at Zeittaung when the attack was made. Not finding
Po Hkine or his wife, Saga had dragged down from the
house two old women, Po Hkine's mother and aunt,
and tortured them by burning parts of their bodies with
lighted torches. The elder of the two women was severely
burnt and was lying on the ground: the other was sitting.
Both were in great pain. We questioned the two women.
They said the gang had come straight to their house
shouting out 'Saga! Saga!' and on finding that Po
Hkine was not there had gone up the bamboo steps
and dragged them to the ground. They then reproached
them with allowing Po Hkine to surrender and demanded
all the money and jewelry in the house. The old women
gave up all their money and their ornaments, but nevertheless
they were tied up, a bamboo mat with a hole cut
to allow the head to pass through was put over them, and
two or three of the gang held lighted torches to their backs
and between their legs. The villagers were too afraid to
yield any assistance. The women fainted, and the dacoits
left them lying on the ground. The villagers were doing
their best to soothe the two women and alleviate the pain
when we came to the house.</p>

<p>"I have known of several cases in which women have
been regularly trussed and suspended over a fire by dacoits
till they gave up their money and ornaments.</p>

<p>"I can recall one case in which dacoits pushed wood
shavings up between a woman's legs and set them on fire.</p>

<p>"In several cases of this kind that have occurred within
my own knowledge the unfortunate women have died."</p>

<p>But I must have surfeited the reader with robberies
and murders and savage cruelties. My purpose has been
to draw a true picture of the conditions with which we had
to deal. There may be some who think that stern measures
of repression are wrong and that under all conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
kindness and forbearance should be the only weapons
of a civilized Government. It is to be wished that such
persons could have an opportunity of testing their theories
without danger to any but themselves.</p>

<p>It is well, however, to record as a matter of history that,
so far as was practicable, the rank and file of those who joined
insurgent or brigand gangs were treated leniently. They
were freely pardoned, if they had not committed murder,
on condition that they surrendered with their arms and
engaged to live quietly in their villages. Where it was
necessary and possible, work was provided for them. When
I left Burma there were thousands who had so surrendered
and were living honest lives. Very few, I believe, went
back to the wild life.</p>

<p>There were a very large number of men, especially in the
early years, who were run down and captured and sentenced
by the magistrates to long terms of imprisonment. It would
have done infinite mischief if these men had been released
after a short time and allowed to join their old companions.</p>

<p>I opposed the idea of a general jail delivery. When it
became possible, the cases were examined under my orders
by an experienced officer and the sentences were revised.
It was not a task that could be done without labour, care,
and knowledge. It was necessary to consider the condition
of the district to which each man belonged. If that district
was still disturbed, and especially if the gang of which he
had been a member was still holding together, it would have
been foolish weakness to send him back again. As a dog
returns to his vomit, so does a dacoit to his gang, if he can
find it. The magistrate is bound to think of the people
who may suffer, rather than of the criminal who had preyed
upon them. In Burma at least we had not outgrown this
primitive morality. No one who had had my experience
of the difficulty of catching these very interesting gentlemen
would have cared to let them loose again.</p>


<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The First Durbar in the Shan States.</span></div>

<p>About this time I was able to carry out an intention
I had formed of visiting Fort Stedman and meeting all
the Shan chiefs and notables.</p>

<p>The distance from the nearest point in the plains to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Fort Stedman was seventy miles, of which fifty-six were
through the hills. The road was under construction, but in
that state which made it worse travelling than the bullock-path
it was meant to supersede.</p>

<p>The journey would take altogether about fourteen days,
and it was not easy for me to get away from other business
for so long a time. Nor was it possible always to summon
the chiefs away from their headquarters.</p>

<p>The ride up through the hills was very beautiful, and
the view from the range commanding the great lake of
Inle was one of the finest I had seen in Burma.</p>

<p>Fort Stedman lies on the further or eastern shore of
the lake, and after a long and hot ride we had to wait
for a considerable time for the State boat of the Yawnghwè
Sawbwa who was bringing Mr. Hildebrand across.</p>

<p>At the landing-place I found a guard of honour of the
Shan levy under Captain Tonnochy, the Commandant, and
at the village bazaar higher up all the chiefs had assembled
to meet me. On the next day I held an informal reception
of all the Sawbwas and other potentates.</p>

<p>A large hall, mostly of bamboo, had been constructed
on the parade-ground, and in this, on the 19th of March,
I received the chiefs. All the chiefs, with the exception
of a few, were present. Many of them met me for the first
time, and I learnt that to most of them also it was the
first occasion of their meeting with their fellow-chiefs.
They were presented to me in turn, and the Sawbwas
of Möngnai and Yawnghwè, who it was considered had
rendered services of some value to the British Government,
received the medal and gold chain of honour given by
the Viceroy for local services in Burma.</p>

<p>It was a notable assemblage. It was the first occasion
on which all these potentates of various degrees, who had
for years previously been fighting amongst themselves or
rebelling against Burmese tyranny, had been brought
together in peace and harmony under a strong rule. Each
of them had made his formal submission to the Queen-Empress.
Each had received a patent confirming him in
his rights and position as head of his State. Each of them
knew that the reign of peace had begun and that he was
henceforth secure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>I reminded them that this was the work of the
British power, and that it had been carried out without
their assistance by the soldiers of the Queen-Empress
and at the cost of her Government of India.</p>

<p>I pointed out to them that they, the Shan chiefs, had
duties and obligations on their side: primarily the good
government of their peoples, the impartial administration
of justice, the development of their territories by roads,
and the improvement of agriculture and trade. "I do not
want you," I said, "to imitate or adopt the forms or
methods of British government; but I think you can
do much by a careful choice of your subordinates, by the
judicious curtailment of the right to carry arms, by suppressing
the extravagant and public gambling which,
experience shows, invariably leads first to ruin and then to
crime."</p>

<p>Lastly, I explained to them that they could not be
excused from paying tribute, the amount of which would
be adjusted to their ability. The British Government was
maintaining garrisons for their benefit, and had undertaken
costly expeditions for their defence. It was necessary
to ask them to remember their obligations.</p>

<p>The first assessment of the Shan States to tribute was
made in 1887-8, on the basis of the sums paid to the
King of Burma, so far as they could be ascertained. The
country had, however, suffered very greatly from the prevailing
anarchy, and many of the States were depopulated
and the land was lying waste. Much of the nominal
demand had to be remitted. Even now (in 1911) the tribute
received by the Government (which may be taken to be
at most not more than one-third of the revenue collected
from the people by their chiefs) hardly covers the expense
of administration, including the garrison of fifteen hundred
military police who maintain internal order and guard the
frontiers. The vast sums expended on the Mandalay-Lashio
railway in the Northern States and on the road connecting
the Southern States with the Toungoo-Mandalay railway
have not been repaid, except by the increased prosperity
of the country.</p>

<p>The Shan population may be taken at about one million
two hundred thousand persons. It would be a high estimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of the incidence of the tribute received by the Government
if it were reckoned at sixpence per head. As a source of
revenue, therefore, the Shan States are not of much account.
The country, however, has improved&mdash;slowly, it is true,
but without interruption. The railway from Mandalay to
Lashio has done much for the Northern States. That
now under construction from the Toungoo-Mandalay line
to the headquarters of the Southern States will have greater
and more rapid effect on that fertile country. I fully
anticipate rapid progress in the near future. It is something
to be able to say that since my visit to Fort Stedman
in March, 1890, the peace of the Shan States has not
been broken, except by a few small local risings of the
wilder tribes (not Shans) in the mountains on the north
and on the east.</p>

<p>To the student of the science of politics the Shan States
will prove, perhaps, the most interesting field of observation
in the province under the Lieutenant-Governor of Burma.
There is nothing quite of the same character in India.
When we occupied the country, the condition of the Shan
chiefs had more resemblance to that of the petty chiefs
and Rajas in the central provinces of India before Sir
Richard Temple dealt with them, than to any other Indian
example. But Temple gave to the larger States the
character of feudatory rulers of foreign territory outside
of British India, whereas, as I have mentioned below,
in the chapter on the Shan Expedition of 1887-8, the
Shan States one and all were made part of British India
by the proclamation annexing Burma.</p>

<p>There is nothing in India similar to this case; where
a great territory of sixty thousand square miles, being
by law an integral part of British India, is administered
not through the regular officials and courts, but directly
by many quasi-independent chiefs, each supreme in his
own territory, but guided and controlled by British officers,
whose advice they are bound by their engagements to
follow.</p>

<p>It results from these conflicting conditions that everything
has to be done by or under some legal enactment.
If the ordinary laws of British India (for example, the
codes of criminal law and procedure) do not apply, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
because under the Shan States Act or some other enactment
the local Government has suspended their operation
and has substituted other rules to which the force of law
has been given.</p>

<p>In the Feudatory States of India, on the other hand,
any interference which becomes necessary is exercised not
by virtue of an enactment of the legislature, but by the
use of the sovereign executive power.</p>

<p>That this difference is vital there can be little doubt.
At present it is the policy, and no doubt the wise policy,
of the Government of India to avoid interfering with the
native States, as much as may be, even by way of advice.</p>

<p>An Indian ruler can do as he likes, and it is only in
gross cases of misrule which are clearly injurious to the
people, and the consequences of which extend, or are likely
to extend, beyond the boundaries of the State, that the
sovereign Government feels compelled to intervene.</p>

<p>In the Shan case the local Government has the power
by law of interfering and controlling the chief, and it will
feel bound to use it.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to watch to which side the tendency
will be. As the people advance in condition and education,
and as the chiefs become more intelligent and trained to
affairs, will the control of the executive increase or diminish?
Will the tendency be, as in India, for the executive Government
to withdraw into the background and leave the chief
to govern, or will the chief tend to become an official of
the State, exercising his powers under the restrictions and
forms, and subject to the appellate and revisional powers
of the regular courts? Up to the present time the control
has tended to become more close.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

GRADUAL CREATION OF AN EFFICIENT POLICE FORCE</h2>


<p>Lord Dufferin left India in December, 1888. I
went to Calcutta to see him before he left, and had
the honour of being introduced by him to the new Viceroy,
the Marquis of Lansdowne. I had reason to be very
grateful to Lord Dufferin for his confidence and encouragement
and unceasing support, and if he could have stayed
to see the work finished it would have given me infinite
satisfaction. I had no less cause, however, to be thankful
to Lord Lansdowne.</p>

<p>During the four years I was in Burma, I was in constant
communication with the Viceroy; and every week, unless I
was absent in distant places, I wrote to him confidentially,
keeping him fully informed of events and of my wants and
wishes. Lord Dufferin had asked me to write to him in
full confidence and regularly, and Lord Lansdowne allowed
me to continue the practice. It was an addition, and often
not an insignificant addition, to my work. It repaid me,
for it established and maintained confidential relations
between the Viceroy and his subordinate in Burma. It
was a great help to the Chief Commissioner, who had no
one on the spot to whom he could open his mind.</p>

<p>I have noticed already the change in the province and
the diversion of attention from the interior to the frontier
districts. This change shows itself very clearly in my
correspondence with the Viceroy, which reflected the
matters giving me most anxiety from week to week.
During the first half of 1889 the affairs of the frontiers
occupied the chief place. I have given their history in
separate chapters.</p>

<p>It might be thought, from the space I have given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
dacoits and their leaders, that the time had hardly yet
come for reducing the military police. In truth the
struggle with the dacoits was drawing to a close, and
the forces of order were winning all along the line. The
outbursts in Magwè and elsewhere were like the last dying
efforts of a fire.</p>

<p>The extent to which the military police and the troops
had changed places can best be understood from this, that
on the 1st of January, 1887, the troops held one hundred and
forty-two posts and the military police fifty-six. On the
1st of January, 1889, the police held one hundred and ninety-two
posts and the troops forty-one. And the state of the
province was such as to lead me to consider the possibility
of reducing the military police strength.</p>

<p>It has been seen how the withdrawal of the troops led
for a time to renewed activity on the part of the discontented
and criminal classes.</p>

<p>With this experience before us it was resolved to move
with the greatest caution, and to feel our way step by step.
The following procedure was adopted. The state of each
district and of its subdivisions was carefully reviewed. The
posts which might be altogether withdrawn were first
selected, then those of which the garrisons might be reduced
in numbers. The changes thus determined were
to be made gradually, so as to attract as little attention
as might be. The men brought in from the posts were
not to leave the district at once, but were to remain at
headquarters, where their discipline, drill, and musketry
could be worked up.</p>

<p>If it should appear from an increase in disorder that reduction
had been premature, the mistake could be remedied
at once by ordering the men back to their posts. If, on
the contrary, no mischief followed, the surplus men were
to be drafted, by companies if possible, into a provincial
reserve battalion, which would be brought to a high
standard of military efficiency, and would be available
in case of need for any part of the province. Finally, when
the reserve battalion became crowded, I proposed to offer
the trained companies to the army, if the Commander-in-Chief
would accept them and if the men would take
military service, of which there was no doubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>This scheme was carried out, and continued until the
strength of the military police force was not greater than
the Government of Burma needed.</p>

<p>Another change was made in order to reduce the
forces, namely, the amalgamation of two or more battalions
under one Commandant. It was necessary at first to give
a separate battalion to each district, in order that each
Deputy Commissioner should have a sufficient force of
military police at his hand and under his control. But
when the country became peaceful and active service was
rarely called for, there was no reason for maintaining an
organization that was costly in money and men. Thus
by doubling up the battalions, aggregating nineteen companies,
in the Eastern Division, into one battalion of fifteen
companies, four companies were saved and drafted into the
Reserve.</p>

<p>This process went on until, in the year 1892, seven fine
regiments had been given to the army. These were
treated at first and for some time as local regiments
attached to the province. Of late years, however, the
policy in the Indian Army has been to obliterate all local
distinctions and to make service general.</p>

<p>The strength of the military police in Upper Burma
now is, I understand, fifteen thousand men in round
numbers. The strength in 1889 was eighteen thousand.
The reduction, therefore, has not been so very great. The
fact is that no sooner had the interior of the province been
reduced to order, than fresh territory began to come under
administration. Vast tracts of hill country on the east,
on the north, and on the west, which were left to themselves
in 1890, are now held by the military police. From
the frontier of French Indo-China on the east to the Bengal
boundary on the west, and northwards along the Chinese
boundary wherever it may be, the military police keep the
marches of Burma. In the mountains inhabited by Kachin
tribes on the north and east of the Myitkyina district, the
whole of this troublesome borderland is held by the police.
Sixteen hundred and twelve rifles, with forty-one native
officers and nine British officers, more than a tenth of the
whole strength, are stationed in this district, which in 1887<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
was outside the pale. The Shan States and the Chin country
are similarly garrisoned.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>I have always felt that our failure to train the Burmans
to be soldiers is a blot on our escutcheon. I have
mentioned an experiment to enlist Karens. This succeeded
for a time. The men learnt their drill quickly, and as
trackers and for forest work they were very useful. It
was decided in 1891 to raise a Karen battalion, with which,
and an Indian battalion, it was proposed to form a military
police force for Lower Burma. The Karens were placed
on the same footing as the Indians, and British officers
were appointed to command them. In drill, endurance in
the field, and courage, the Karen showed himself a good
man. But from some cause he failed in discipline, and
in 1899 it was found advisable, owing to insubordinate
conduct, to disband the battalion and distribute the companies
among the Indian battalions. There has been more
success, I am told, with the Kachins, who are showing
themselves trustworthy. They are certainly a strong race,
probably the strongest we have in Burma.</p>

<p>Another direction in which the change from the sword
to the plough and the pen was showing itself was in the
prominence given to the administration of the civil police.
It is very easy to get up a cry against the police in Burma
or in India, but they will not be improved by constant
abuse, frequent prosecutions, censures, and condemnations
by High Court judges, or still less competent critics, or by
other methods of giving a service a bad name.</p>

<p>One of the hardest tasks connected with the administration
of a country by foreign rulers is the creation of a good
police force. When the people from whom the force has
to be recruited have lived for years under a despotic and
altogether corrupt government, the task becomes doubly
hard. And when the foreigners appointed to officer and
train the force have for the most part no knowledge of
police work and no acquaintance with the vernacular of
the people, the task would have made Hercules drown
himself in the nearest ditch.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p>It had to be done, however, and it was undertaken. The
work had not gone far in 1890, but it was started, and two
good and experienced police officers of high standing had
been appointed to go round Upper Burma, district by
district, and instruct the English officers. It was not
possible at that time to find Burmans fit to take charge
of the police of a district. I do not know whether such
men are yet forthcoming.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> We are well advanced in the
second century of our rule in India, yet I believe there
are few Indian gentlemen who are willing to take an appointment
in the police and fewer still who are well fitted
for it.</p>

<p>The question of the civil police in Lower Burma was
taken up systematically in 1888. A committee was appointed
by me to diagnose the ailment from which the
police were suffering, and to prescribe remedies. On their
report in 1889 a scheme was drawn up, the main features
of which were the division of the Lower Burma force into
military and civil, the former, as in Upper Burma, to
be recruited from India and partly, it was then hoped,
from the Karen people, the latter to be natives of the
country. To the latter was to be entrusted all police
work of detection and prevention. They were to be subjected
to drill and discipline and accustomed to stand alone,
and they were to be schooled and trained to police duties.
The military police force was to be organized as one
regiment under a military officer. Their headquarters
were to be in Rangoon, and they were to furnish such
detachments for outdistricts as might be wanted from time
to time. This scheme, with little alteration, was carried
out in 1891, and I believe is still in force.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

THE SHAN STATES</h2>


<p>The country inhabited by the Burmans, properly so
called, may be described roughly as the valleys of the
Irrawaddy and Chindwin Rivers, south of 23 N. Latitude.
The hills which bound the Irrawaddy Valley on the east,
close in the great river in its northern reaches, and as far
south as Mandalay. Below that point the river turns
westward and leaves a widening plain between its left
bank, and the spurs of the Eastern Range, which rise
abruptly from the low ground. The passes through this
range lead to a hilly plateau, the altitude of which is
from two to four thousand feet above sea-level rising
occasionally to five and six thousand feet. This plateau
is intersected from north to south by the Salween River,
which, rising somewhere in the mountains to the north-west
of Yunnan, enters the sea at Moulmein. The channel
of the Salween is in most places deep. To the east the high
land continues, but is rougher and more mountainous, and
rises until the watershed between the Salween and the
Mekong is crossed. The descent to the Mekong is then
made through difficult and rugged country much cut up by
watercourses. The Shan States, which were at the time of
the annexation tributary to the Burman monarch, are
situated, with some insignificant exceptions, on this plateau.</p>

<p>The Shans are a distinct race from the Burmans. The
existing Burmese people may be traced, it is said, to tribes
dwelling in the Eastern Himalaya and the adjoining region
of Thibet. The Tai or Siamese branch of the Indo-Chinese
people, called Shan by the Burmese, are supposed to have
migrated from their original seat in Central Asia towards the
south, and to have settled along the rivers Mekong, Menam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Irrawaddy, and Brahmaputra. They are found as a distinct
race from the borders of Manipur to the heart of Yunnan, and
from the Valley of Assam to Bangkok and Cambodia.
Major H. R. Davies found them occupying most of the low-lying
valleys in Southern Yunnan, and on the Tongking
border, and in small communities even in Northern Yunnan
and on the Upper Yangtze. Although so widely spread, in
some cases even scattered, and, except in Siam, subjected to
alien races, they have preserved to a great extent a common
language and national character.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> In religion they are
Buddhist of the Burmese type, but less strict in the observance
of religious duties and ceremonies and less regardful
of animal life. They are in many ways a civilized people,
unwarlike, and given to agriculture and commerce. They
are not unfriendly to foreigners. "I must have travelled,"
writes Major Davies, "some fifteen hundred miles through
Shan countries, and I never remember any difference of
opinion, or unpleasantness of any kind."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>"It may be accepted as historical," says Phayre, "that
the Tai race became supreme in the country of the Upper
Irrawaddy early in the Christian Era and continued to be so
under a consolidated monarchy for several centuries. About
the ninth century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> it began to break up into separate
States which eventually were conquered by the Burmans."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
In the Irrawaddy Valley the Shans lost their autonomy, and
were amalgamated with the Burman population; but those
on the high plateau to the east continued to be governed by
their own chiefs, according to their own customs, subject to
the suzerainty of Burma. Some small States west of the
Irrawaddy, survived the dissolution of the Shan kingdom,
and they also enjoyed a similar but less marked independence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Up to the time of the annexation at the end of 1885, the
King of Burma had exercised a real, although spasmodic
and irregular control over the Shan chiefs. In theory the
office of chief, or Sawbwa, was hereditary in the family.
The Sawbwa was supreme in his own territory. He had the
power of life and death, and so far as his subjects were concerned,
wielded absolute authority unfettered by any rule
stronger than custom. The character of the Government
varied in consequence with the personal character of the
chief. The main check on oppression was the facility with
which the people could emigrate into some neighbouring
State. In practice, however, the Burma Government did not
scruple to interfere with the Sawbwa; and this interference
was the chief cause of the strife and contention which
divided and ruined the country. A Burmese Bo-hmumintha,
or Resident, to use the Indian term, had his seat of
administration at Möngnai, and was supported by a force of
brigands rather than soldiers. He was assisted by political
agents subordinate to him residing in some of the more
important States.</p>

<p>The interference thus exercised was seldom if ever in the
interests of good administration. As a rule it was confined
to efforts to raise a revenue. Tolls and exactions at various
points on the trade routes were numerous and oppressive;
enough at times to obstruct commerce, and even to close a
trade route altogether for a season. The ease, however, with
which another road could be found, and the duty evaded,
was some check, and the Shans, who are industrious cultivators
and born traders, contrived to remain fairly prosperous
and not much below their Burman neighbours in
wealth and comfort. As in Burma, while there were some
rich men, there was no real poverty. No one but the idle
and vicious needed to be in want.</p>

<p>The office of Sawbwa was, as has been said, hereditary in
theory, and it does not seem that the Burmese Government
diverted the succession from mere caprice or favouritism.
Some pains were taken to secure the loyalty of the chiefs.
The King not seldom invited the sons of Sawbwas to the
Court of Ava at an early age, for the twofold purpose of
rearing them under Court influence, and of keeping them
as hostages for their fathers' good conduct. Notwithstanding
this marked subordination to the King of Burma, each chief
assumed the same insignia and marks of royalty as his
Suzerain, and in his own view, and to his subjects, probably,
was a great and independent monarch.</p>

<p>It has been said that the influence of the Burmese Government
was seldom in the interests of good administration.
On the contrary, it was frequently used to stir up strife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
between the Sawbwas, in order to prevent them from combining
against the King. Not unnaturally, therefore, he
was not always regarded with feelings of loyalty or affection.
Rebellions against his government were frequent, but owing
to the want of cohesion amongst the Shans, and the absence
of a leader of capacity to unite them and to organize resistance,
even the loose-jointed Mandalay administration was
able to put down revolt without difficulty. It was done with
ruthless severity. There was little inclination on the part of
the Sawbwas, in spite of this oppression, to seek aid or protection
from the Siamese, whose rule would not have been a
change for the better. The Möngnai Sawbwa and others,
after failing in a rebellion against Burma, sought refuge
in Kengtung, the largest and most powerful of the Trans-Salween
States, which had some traditional connection
with China, and owing to its distance from Burma, and
the rugged nature of the intervening country, enjoyed more
than a shadow of independence. Nor did those States which
lie on the Mekong and formerly owned or claimed to own
territory on the east bank, invite Chinese protection. Their
feelings towards China were friendly enough. But their
position on the very extremity of that Empire, where there
was little life in the administration, rendered it unsafe to
lean on help from that quarter.</p>

<p>A letter written to the Chief Commissioner by the
Sawbwa of Hsipaw (Northern Shan States) in 1886 shows
the attitude of the Shan Chiefs towards Burma and
China.</p>

<p>"During the last war between the English and the
Burmese," he writes, "the Chinese Emperor placed 300,000
men at Maingmawgyi to guard the Chinese frontier. The
Chinese officials wrote to the Sawbwas inviting them to a
conference at Maingmawgyi to draw up a friendly treaty,
as the Burmese King had been taken away by the
English.</p>

<p>"But I am under great obligations to the Queen-Empress,
so I made answer thus: 'From time immemorial we
Shans have not sought protection either from China or
Burma; of late, however, the Burmans, regardless of law
and justice, have exacted our submission to them by force
of arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Since the conquest of Burma by the British and the
removal of the Burmese King, the Sawbwas and Myozas
have been trying their best to restore peace and order.
And now we are asked to come to Maingmawgyi and draw
up a treaty of friendship. We cannot respond to the
invitation as yet. We, chiefs of the Shan country, must
first of all consider which side could confer on us peace
and happiness, and then enter into friendly relations with
the Government of such side.'"</p>

<p>The problem before the Administration of Burma in
1886 was, to use the political slang of to-day, "The
peaceful penetration" of the Shan country. The mantle
of the Burmese monarch had fallen on the shoulders of
the British Government. The Shan chiefs and their people
had to be persuaded to make submission to the Queen-Empress
and to accept her as their overlord. This
persuasion had to be effected if possible without the use
of force. A show of force, however, was necessary. During
1886 the despatch of an expedition to the Shan States
was impossible. The work on hand in Upper Burma was
more than enough. Thus it happened that until 1887
the only attempt to make British influence felt in the
Shan States was the deputation of an officer with a small
force to Hsumhsai, a small State lying between Mandalay
and Hsipaw.</p>

<p>To make the measures taken to solve this problem
intelligible, a brief account must be given of events in
the Shan country immediately preceding and following
the deposition of the King of Burma. The grouping of
the States for administrative purposes into North and
South, which was not inherited from the Burman Government
and was not founded on any distinction recognized
by the Shans, had its origin in these events. The States,
the history of which is of most importance in this connection,
are Hsenwi and Hsipaw, to the north of Mandalay;
Yawnghwè and Möngnai farther south; and, on
the east of the Salween, the large State of Kengtung.</p>

<p>Hsipaw lies in the hills on the Mandalay-Lashio road,
about one hundred and thirty miles from the capital of Upper
Burma. The Sawbwa, by name Hkun Saing, was the first of
the Shan chiefs who came in contact with the British Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and the first to submit himself to the suzerainty of the
Queen-Empress after the annexation. The circumstances
which led to his contact with the British are these. In
1882 Hkun Saing incurred the displeasure of King Thebaw
and fled to escape his vengeance. After some wanderings,
which extended, it is said, into Siam, he came to Rangoon,
and with a wife and servants settled in the Kemmendine
suburb. He lived, he said, in fear of assassination by
agents of the King, and doubted the fidelity of some of
his followers. In 1883 his fears, apparently, overcame him,
and he shot down two of his men whom he accused, I
believe not without reason, of plotting against his life.
He was arrested, tried for murder before the Recorder of
Rangoon, and condemned to death.</p>

<p>The sentence was commuted by the Chief Commissioner
to transportation, and he was confined in the jail at
Rangoon. The Chief Commissioner visited Hkun Saing
a few days after the beginning of his imprisonment, and
found him taking his punishment like a man, uttering no
complaints and working with a will at the task<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> imposed
on him. The jail authorities were then instructed to treat
him as a political prisoner. After a sufficient time had
elapsed to make it plain to independent chiefs that if
they sought refuge in British territory they must submit
themselves to British law, he was released on condition
that he left our jurisdiction. He retired to Eastern Karenni,
and lived under the protection of Sawlapaw, the chief of
that country. On the removal of the King of Burma, he
obtained some assistance in men and money from Sawlapaw,
and made his way to his own territory.</p>

<p>Meanwhile much had been happening there and in the
neighbouring States during his absence.</p>

<p>To the east and north-east of Hsipaw is the State of
Hsenwi, which is one of the largest divisions of the Shan
country. The tract known by this name contains nearly
twelve thousand square miles. On the north and north-east
it is bordered by Chinese Shan States. The population
of the State is said to number about one hundred
and fifty thousand and is of mixed races, the pure Shans
being outnumbered by Kachins, Palaungs, and Chinese.
For many years Hsenwi had been torn by dissension.
Frequent struggles between rival claimants to the chiefship,
as frequent appeals to Burma by the party who for
the time was worsted, had distracted and ruined the
country. At the time of the annexation of Upper Burma
Naw Hpa was the titular Sawbwa, one of whose daughters
had been espoused by King Mindon. He was the representative
of the ancient ruling family of Hsenwi and had
been expelled by a usurper named Sang Hai. The story
is worth telling as an illustration of Burmese ways.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>
<p>About the middle of last century the Siamese made an
attack on the Trans-Salween State of Kengtung. The Cis-Salween
States were called upon for contingents to form
a force to repel the invasion, and Sang Hai, who was previously
unknown, led the Hsenwi men to victory and won
much renown. On his return, finding himself at the head
of victorious troops, he rebelled against his lawful ruler
Naw Hpa, and turned him out.</p>

<p>Naw Hpa was summoned to Mandalay, and condemned
to imprisonment for having failed to maintain his authority,
while a cadet of the Hsenwi house was appointed in his
stead. This cadet, U Po by name, was driven away ignominiously
by Sang Hai, and was recalled to Mandalay and
sent to join Naw Hpa in jail. Numerous Burmese officials
of high rank with imposing titles were sent up one after
another, and one after another was expelled by Sang Hai,
and they came back, in the order of their going, to join
the company of failures in Mandalay prison.</p>

<p>At last, about 1877, all the Sawbwas from Yawnghwè to
Möng Löng were ordered to make a combined attack on Sang
Hai. This was too much for the usurper. He went east
of the Salween, and Naw Hpa was sent back to rule a
ruined and distracted country. But Sang Hai before he
retired had thrown his mantle over the shoulders of his
son-in-law, San Ton Hon, who was for a Shan a good
fighting-man. The unlucky Naw Hpa was driven out
once more, and again ordered to Mandalay to explain his
failure to hold his own. He knew by experience what this
meant, and deputed his son, who was known as the Naw
Möng, to represent him at Court, or rather in prison, while
he himself took refuge with the Kachins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>When Thebaw succeeded his father Mindon, he imprisoned
his stepmother, the Hsenwi Queen, Naw Hpa's
daughter, and killed her son. And as Naw Hpa himself
was a refugee and Naw Möng was in jail San Ton Hon
was left free to establish himself in Hsenwi, or rather in
the Northern and Eastern Divisions of the State. The
Southern, known as the Taunglet, had already broken away
and separated into four petty chiefships. The middle
portion, called the Alelet, was governed in a fashion by
Sang Aw, commonly know as the Pa-ôk-Chok, who had his
headquarters at Möngyai. A Burmese official with a small
force had been left at Lashio, but unable to support himself
against San Ton Hon he withdrew as soon as he heard
of the fall of the Monarchy.</p>

<p>On the British occupation of Mandalay the son of
Naw Hpa, Naw Möng, who had been imprisoned by
Thebaw, was set free. He made his way into Hsenwi,
collected followers, and seized the capital, which had been
evacuated by the Burmans. He was quickly expelled,
however, by San Ton Hon. Meanwhile his father, Naw
Hpa, with a following of Kachins, came upon the scene,
and another element of strife appeared in the Myinzaing
Prince, who had been imprisoned by the King and
along with other political prisoners was released on the
occupation of Mandalay. He made his way to the Shan
hills and endeavoured to collect followers and oppose the
British. His cause appears to have been taken up by Naw
Hpa and Naw Möng, in the hope of strengthening their
own party. A confederacy was formed to raise the
standard of the Myinzaing Prince. The plan of campaign
was to seize possession of this part of the Shan country.
Hsipaw was to be assigned to Naw Möng, while Hsenwi
was to be restored to Naw Hpa. The town of Hsipaw
was attacked and completely wrecked, and a movement was
directed against San Ton Hon.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of affairs when Hkun Saing
made his way back from the Karenni country. After some
opposition he made himself master of Hsipaw, to find the place
in ruins, the only house standing being his own <i>haw</i>, or
palace, which had been spared in fear, it was said, of the
Spirit of the Palace. Under these circumstances it was
natural that Hkun Saing, the lawful Sawbwa of Hsipaw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and San Ton Hon, the <i>de facto</i> chief of Northern Hsenwi,
should make common cause against the confederacy headed
by Naw Hpa and his son. This was in July, 1886.</p>

<p>Between the Hsipaw State and Mandalay on the western
border of the Shan plateau lies the small State of Hsumhsai,
known to the Burmans as Thonze. It was formerly ruled by
its own chief, and had been a very prosperous little district.
Its position within easy reach of Mandalay exposed it to
the constant and mischievous interference of the Burman
Government. For forty years before the annexation it had
been administered by Burmese officials, but with some
regard to Shan customs and sentiment. In 1886, after
the British occupation of Mandalay, it became a bone of
contention between Kun Meik, acting for his brother
the Sawbwa of Hsipaw, and the Myinzaing Prince, who
had occupied this part of the plateau. There were two
men of influence in Thonze, Maung Sa and Maung Se.
Maung Sa attached himself to Kun Meik, and Maung Se
to the Myinzaing Prince. They fought with varying
fortune for some time. Eventually Kun Meik was
forced back to Hsipaw. The Myinzaing party remained
masters of Hsumhsai for some months, pillaging and
destroying everything. The trade route was entirely closed
throughout the year 1886, and traffic between Mandalay
and the Shan States either ceased or followed a very
circuitous route.</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner and the military commanders
had so much on their hands in 1886 that the question of the
Shan country was of necessity postponed. In November,
however, it was found imperative to give attention to affairs
in Hsumhsai. A column under Colonel E. Stedman,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> with
Mr. H. Thirkell White<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> as civil officer, was sent to reopen the
road and restore order. Mr. White recorded that at the
time of his arrival (18th of November, 1886) "The country
was to a great extent deserted, villages had been abandoned,
and many of the inhabitants had fled to the neighbouring
States of Mönglon, Hsipaw, and Lawksawk, but chiefly
to Mönglon. Much of the land had been left uncultivated;
the road was neglected and overgrown with long grass.
These evidences of disorder we saw as we passed through
Hsumhsai, and I learned from the people that the state of the
rest of the country was the same as that of the part which
we saw." It may be noted here that when Hkun Saing, the
Sawbwa of Hsipaw, came to Mandalay in 1887 to meet
Sir Charles Bernard, he laid claim to three small States&mdash;Hsumhsai,
Mönglon, and Möntung&mdash;as formerly belonging
to him. Inasmuch as Hkun Saing was the first
Shan chief to acknowledge the supremacy of the British
Government, there was a desire to make much of him
and to meet his wishes. These three States were
made over to him without going into the merits of the
case. At the time the intricacies of Shan politics were little
understood. The people of Mönglon especially were averse
to being subjected to the Sawbwa, who failed to govern
justly or efficiently, and the settlement of this part of the
country became very difficult. The ultimate result in consolidating
the States under one chief has, I believe, been
good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Another State of which it is useful to give some special
account is Yawnghwè, called by the Burmese Nyaungywe.
Yawnghwè is in the Central, or Myélat, Division of the
Shan States, and is easily accessible from the plains. It is
remarkable for its physical formation. A broad valley running
from the north to the south forms the western half of
the State, and the centre of this valley is the Inle Lake, a
large expanse of water covering an area of seventy square
miles (<i>Upper Burma Gazetteer</i>). The eastern side of the
State is hilly, and some of the ranges rise to six thousand feet
and more. Yawnghwè, it is said, in former days ruled the
country from the Hsipaw border on the north to Karenni
on the south. It was undoubtedly the most prominent State
in the Myélat.</p>

<p>At the time of the occupation of Mandalay by the British,
Saw Möng was Sawbwa. He had gone down to Mandalay
in 1885 to see King Thebaw. It is said that he brought
back with him to Yawnghwè the Legya Queen, one of King
Mindon's wives, and her son, whose standard he set up,
calling on all the chiefs to aid him to fight the British
and retake Mandalay. A combination of small States was
formed against him, and he was wounded in both legs and
obliged to retire. Being thus incapacitated, he sent for his
half-brother, Saw Ôn, and handed the conduct of affairs to
him while he went to Mandalay to recover from his hurt.
Saw Ôn defeated the hostile party, and having established
his authority, took possession of the State and told Saw
Möng he need not return. Meanwhile the Limbin confederacy
had been formed, and Saw Ôn was called upon
to join it. He refused, and shrewdly proclaimed himself an
adherent of the British Government and appealed to the
Chief Commissioner for aid.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 577px;">
<img src="images/i176.jpg" width="577" height="800" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Saw Maung, Sawbwa of Yawnghwè, and his Consort.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>
<p>In order to explain the appearance of the Limbin confederacy,
we must now go eastward of the Salween to the
State of Kengtung. This chieftainship is one of the largest
of the States, and comprises about twelve thousand square
miles. It lies between the Salween and the Mekong, touching
both rivers. Owing to its distance from Mandalay and the
very rugged and mountainous nature of the country between
the two rivers, Kengtung of late years had been left to
itself by the Burman Government. Soon after Thebaw's
accession to the Kingdom of Ava, many of the Shan States
revolted against him, and Kengtung took a conspicuous
part in the rebellion. The Sawbwa seized the Burmese
Resident and his escort and put them to death. He attacked
the adjacent and smaller State of Kengcheng and turned
out the chief, installing in his room a man of his own.
It so happened that the Chinese had occasion about this
time to strengthen their forces in Southern Yunnan, probably
as a precaution against French aggression. Hearing
of the action taken by Kengtung against Kengcheng, a
large part of which lay east of the Mekong, the Chinese
general sent a force to Kengtung. It was agreed to submit
the dispute between the claimants to the Sawbwaship of
Kengcheng to the Chinese commander. He installed one
of the claimants, and provided against a revival of the
quarrel by decapitating the other. After these events the
authority of the Burman Government ceased to exist in
Kengtung.</p>

<p>In 1882 the Sawbwa of Möngnai and the chiefs of several
neighbouring States revolted against Thebaw and found a
safe refuge in Kengtung. Möngnai is one of the most
important of the States. It contains nearly three thousand
square miles. The River Salween is the boundary on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the east, and divides it from Kengtung. It has been
already mentioned that a Burman Bo-hmu, or Resident,
with an armed force, was stationed in Möngnai, which
derived dignity from being the centre of Burmese power
in the Shan States, and suffered proportionately. The
exactions of the King's Government at last became
intolerable. The Sawbwa, Kun Kyi, was summoned, with
other defaulters, to Mandalay, and imprisoned there until
the sums demanded were paid.</p>

<p>About 1882 Kun Kyi was again summoned to appear.
He preferred to revolt. While the Burmese subordinate
official (the Resident had just died) was preparing to seize
him, he raised his people, led them against the King's
garrison, and destroyed it. On the news reaching Mandalay,
a large force was dispatched to avenge this outrage, and the
Sawbwa, with several other chiefs in like straits, took refuge
in Kengtung. One, Twet Nga Lu, with the assistance of
the Burmese officials, took possession of Möngnai.</p>

<p>Twet Nga Lu was an unfrocked monk, a native of Kengtawng,
a sub-State of Möngnai, who signalized his return
to a worldly life by making himself unpleasant to his
neighbours. He had made an attack on Möngnai, but was
driven off. A younger brother of the Möngnai Sawbwa had
married a lady named Nang U, by whom he had a son.
Whether this nobleman died, or was dismissed by Nang U,
is uncertain. However that may be, she espoused Twet
Nga Lu, and thereupon her minor son was appointed by
the King to be magistrate of Kengtawng with the unfrocked
monk as guardian. This arrangement had taken place
before the retirement of the Sawbwa, Kun Kyi, to Kengtung,
and was very distasteful to him.</p>

<p>It came about thus, that the Sawbwa of Möngnai, the
premier chief in the Shan country with Lawksawk and
several others, all suffering from the King's tyranny, found
themselves in Kengtung.</p>

<p>Naturally they took counsel together regarding the
measures to be adopted for recovering their territories, and
protecting the Shans generally against the oppressive rule
of Burma. It was resolved to form a confederacy under one
leader. Their decision and the reasons for it are stated in
a letter addressed by them to Hkun Saing, the Sawbwa of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Hsipaw, on the 26th of March, 1886. Referring to a communication
which they had received from Hkun Saing, in
which he advised that "it would be beneficial to the
Shans to have their country welded into a congeries of
independent States like Germany," they state their own
views in the form of resolutions, declaring that there is no
hope of establishing peace or putting an end to the endless
strife between the States, unless they are united under one
suzerain. They consider that the interests of their religion
and of the country generally demand the selection of a
supreme ruler, who will combine the Sawbwas and enable
them to withstand any attempt to injure them or their
religion.</p>

<p>Acting on these principles they decided in 1885, before
the British Government had moved against King Thebaw,
to invite the Limbin Prince, one of the Royal Family who
was living in British Burma as a refugee on a small pension
allotted to him by the British Government, to come up to
Kengtung and to accept the position of Suzerain of the
Shan States, with the object of "wresting the crown from
King Thebaw." The Prince accepted the call, and arrived
at Kengtung on December 10, 1885. On his arrival, forces
were raised from Kengtung and the other confederating
States, and advance parties were sent forward under the
command of the Sawbwas of Möngnawng, Möngnai, and
Lawksawk.</p>

<p>The States joining in this enterprise under the nominal
leadership of the Limbin Prince&mdash;a poor creature quite unable
to lead any one&mdash;became known as the Limbin Confederacy.
A counter league was formed by all those interested in
keeping the exiled Sawbwas out of their territories and
maintaining the existing state of things. On the other
hand, the Sawbwas of Möngpawn and several other
influential Sawbwas espoused the cause of the Confederacy.
Twet Nga Lu was the leading spirit of the counter league,
and he directed its forces against the States which were
allied to Möngnai. He was met and defeated by Möngpawn,
and early in the year 1886 Kun Kyi, the Sawbwa of
Möngnai, and his companions in exile had expelled the
usurpers and recovered their territories. The Confederacy
then set themselves to induce or compel other States to join<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
them and to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Limbin
Prince. Saw Ôn, the <i>de facto</i> ruler of Yawnghwè, rejected
their invitation. The Confederacy determined to move
from Möngnai against him, as it was important to force
Yawnghwè, the State adjoining Möngnai on the west, and
the most powerful in the Central, or Myélat, Division, to
give its adherence to the Prince.</p>

<p>The foregoing outline will perhaps suffice to make the
situation at and immediately following the annexation
intelligible.</p>

<p>The danger-points appeared to the Chief Commissioner
to be the critical situations of the two Sawbwas, who had
signified their adherence to the British Government,
namely, Hsipaw in the north and Yawnghwè in the
central portion of the States. Hsipaw and his ally, San
Ton Hon, were pressed by the coalition under Naw Hpa,
Naw Möng, and Prince Saw Yan Naing&mdash;another scion
of Royalty who with his brother had raised their standard
at Chaunggwa, in the Ava district, and after being driven
out of that had eventually joined Naw Möng in Hsenwi.
Yawnghwè was threatened by the powerful Limbin Confederacy,
and had no prospect of help from any neighbouring
State. Both these Sawbwas had declared themselves to be
friends of the British Government, and at the time they
were our only adherents.</p>

<p>The deputation of Mr. Herbert White to Hsumhsai in
1886 has already been mentioned. He succeeded in opening
the trade route between Hsipaw and Mandalay and in
strengthening the position of the Sawbwa Hkun Saing.
Accordingly, when Sir Charles Bernard came to Mandalay
at the end of 1886, Hkun Saing was able to hasten down
to meet him, and to make in person his submission to the
British Government. He was received with much ceremony
by the Chief Commissioner. His loyalty to the Queen-Empress
and belief in her power were not open to doubt.
On his return journey from Mandalay in February, 1887,
Mr. J. E. Bridges, the Deputy Commissioner, with a small
military escort and some officers of the Survey and
Intelligence Departments, accompanied the Sawbwa to
Hsipaw. Mr. Bridges remained there twenty-five days,
gathering information regarding Shan politics and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
country generally, and opening communications with other
States. He came to the conclusion that the Shan chiefs
were little disposed to welcome the advent of British
power. Hkun Saing, the Sawbwa of Hsipaw, stood out
alone as our friend. The party under the flag of the
Chaunggwa Prince, which was striving to eject San Ton
Hon from Hsenwi, was equally hostile to Hsipaw. Much
of the country had been ravaged by the Myinzaing Prince
and his adherents. His view was needlessly despondent.</p>

<p>Before the end of 1886 it had been decided to begin by
sending an expedition to relieve Yawnghwè from the
threatened attack by the Limbin Confederacy. To provide
men for another movement to help Hsipaw was thought to
be impossible. In accordance with a promise made to
Hkun Saing by the Chief Commissioner at their meeting
in Mandalay, a supply of arms and ammunition was sent
to him, which, it was hoped, would enable him and San
Ton Hon to defeat their enemies. It may be stated here
that although some anxiety was felt from time to time
regarding events in Hsenwi and Hsipaw, it did not become
necessary to move troops to their assistance. Naw Hpa
and his son Naw Möng made submission to the Superintendent
at Fort Stedman early in August, 1887, and further
action in the Northern States was deferred until the open
season of 1887-8.</p>

<p>But to return to the end of 1886. Although it had been
impossible to take more active steps to bring the Shan
States into line, the administration had not been idle. The
policy to be adopted towards them generally was thought
out and the main lines were laid down by Sir Charles
Bernard. Letters explaining the principles which would
guide the British Government in its relations to them
were written to the various chiefs. They were assured
that there was no desire to interfere in the internal affairs
of the States. British supremacy must be acknowledged,
peace must be preserved, the people must not be oppressed.
Subject to these conditions and to the payment of a
moderate tribute, the British Government undertook to
recognize the Sawbwas who were in effective possession,
to uphold their rights, and to give freedom and open the
way for commerce. Preparations were made accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
to send an expedition to the Shan plateau. Its immediate
duty was to relieve Yawnghwè. The ultimate purpose was
to establish a political officer with a sufficient military
force in a strong position on the Shan plateau from which
he could, as the representative of British power, control
the States. There was no intention of fighting the Shans.
On the contrary, it was desired to win their friendship and
to induce them to trust us. Already the duties, imposts
and monopolies which strangled trade in the King's time
had been swept away. It remained to establish peace and
to open the trade routes which the prevailing anarchy had
closed.</p>

<p>Hlaingdet was chosen as the starting-point of the expedition
which was to carry out this policy. A force
assembled there in December, 1886, under Colonel E. Stedman
of the 3rd Gurkha Regiment, consisting of&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
2 guns 1-1 E.D.R.A.<br />
Four Companies 2nd Battalion Hampshire Regiment.<br />
Four Companies 3rd Gurkha Regiment.<br />
50 men of the Bombay Sappers and Miners.<br />
40 Mounted Infantry (who joined at Pwehla after the force had started).<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The objects of the expedition, as has been stated, were
peaceful and political. The military commander was responsible
for the disposition of the troops, and in the event
of active operations becoming necessary was to have entire
control. The negotiations with the Shans and the conduct
of affairs generally, apart from purely military matters, were
entrusted to the civil head of the expedition, Mr. A. H.
Hildebrand (at that time Deputy Commissioner of Tharrawaddy).
Ten years previously Mr. Hildebrand had served
on a mission to the Karenni country and had arranged
for the protection of that people from the encroachments
of the King of Burma. Subsequently as District Officer of
the Salween Hill Tracts and later in the Arakan Hills he
had shown his capacity for ruling and influencing half-civilized
peoples. Mr. J. G. Scott, now well known as
Sir George Scott, was appointed to assist him. Mr. Scott
at a former period had been attached to the S. P. G.
College in Rangoon, and under the <i>nom de plume</i> of Shway
Yoe had made a reputation as a writer on Burma and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
people. On the annexation of Upper Burma he had been
appointed to the Commission.</p>

<p>The leaders of the expedition, both civil and military,
were well chosen. Their instructions were to take every
precaution against giving avoidable offence or trouble to
the people, to gain the goodwill of chiefs, priests, and
villagers, to interfere as little as might be with their prejudices,
their religious houses, and their private life.</p>

<p>The move from Hlaingdet was to have been made at once
on the assembling of the force. But the state of the roads
and doubt as to the best route caused delay both at the
outset and afterwards. The hill passes leading to the Shan
country had become very difficult owing to disuse during
the troublous times of 1885-6. In some places also they
had been purposely blocked by the Burman villagers to
protect themselves against Shan cattle-raiders, and by
Shans who wished to obstruct the expedition. It was very
hard to get labourers to clear and repair the roads and make
them passable by the main body of the force and the transport
animals.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of January it was decided to advance, and
Colonel Stedman, with two hundred Gurkhas, proceeded
to occupy Pyinyaung, twenty-two miles from Hlaingdet.
There were doubts as to the best route. As the reports
received from Yawnghwè represented the Sawbwa to be
hard pressed by the Limbin Confederates, Colonel Stedman
resolved to follow the most direct road, disregarding its
difficulty, and pushed on to Kyatsakan and across the
Pyindeik Pass. Singu was occupied on the 20th. Some
show of resistance was made at several places. But it
was very faint-hearted, the enemy being only some Shans
in the service of the Lawksawk Sawbwa, poorly armed and
undisciplined. Mr. Hildebrand had not yet arrived. His
subordinate, Mr. Scott, who performed his duties temporarily,
distributed copies of a proclamation issued by the Chief
Commissioner explaining the motives and objects of the
expedition to the chiefs of the Myélat States, and wrote
letters in his own name to the most prominent men. He
made good use of the time also to explore roads and collect
labour for improving them.</p>

<p>On the 21st of January Mr. Hildebrand with the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of the force joined Colonel Stedman at Singu.
On the 27th of January the main body advanced to
Kaukon, where another feeble attempt at resistance was
made by some of Lawksawk's forces. On the following
day numerous elders from the neighbouring villages came
in and welcomed the British. The constant fighting
between the Limbin's men and their opponents led by
the Yawnghwè Sawbwa, had made life a burden to the
people. The country was being depopulated. No one
dared to sow, not knowing who would reap.</p>

<p>On the 29th of January Pwehla was reached. The
chief villagers and the Pongyis met the column outside
the town, and a favourable and peaceable progress was
anticipated. Hitherto there had been some apprehension
lest the Sawbwa of Yawnghwè, who had represented
himself as being hard pressed by the Limbin Confederacy,
should be overpowered before help could reach him. It
was now ascertained that this fear was unfounded. As
there was no cause for haste, Mr. Hildebrand decided to
take the opportunity of summoning the chiefs of the Myélat
States to appear and to make their submission. There was
an advantage, moreover, in giving the Lawksawk Sawbwa
time to consider his position and to submit peacefully;
and with this object every endeavour was made by letter
and messenger to explain the situation to him.</p>

<p>On the 7th of February the force reached Bawyethat
Pagoda, about half-way between Yawnghwè and Kugyo.
Here it was met by the Sawbwa Saw Ôn, who came with
the full glory of Shan pomp to welcome the British representative.
It was found that a body of men from Lawksawk
had occupied Kugyo, which is in Yawnghwè territory.
Mr. Hildebrand wished to send a letter to the commander
to persuade him to retire his men, but no one could be
found willing to carry it, for fear of the wild Kachins
and Panthays said to be amongst his followers. There
was nothing for it, therefore, but to attack Kugyo, which
was taken on the 9th of February, without loss on our
side. On the 10th the column made a formal entry into
Yawnghwè and was received with much state by the
Sawbwa. It had been intended to fix the headquarters
of the British Administration a little way off, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
country was found to be low-lying and unhealthy. A site
was chosen on the slope which leads up from the great
lake of Yawnghwè to the Hsahtung range. A fort was
built, and named after Colonel Stedman, the officer commanding
the force. Here the headquarters of the Superintendent
of the Southern Shan States were established.</p>

<p>The arrival of the expedition at Yawnghwè was followed
by an immediate change in the attitude of the neighbouring
chiefs. By the middle of February Yawnghwè had been
relieved and the bands attacking him dispersed. The whole
of the Myélat had submitted, most of the chiefs appearing
in person. To the south, Möngpai and others of importance
had accepted the British suzerainty, some by letter
and some in person. To the north, Lawksawk and Möngping
held aloof, but it was hoped to induce them to come
in. Laikha, Möngkung, and Kehsi Mansam had declared
themselves on the British side. Letters were despatched
to Möngnai and all the adjacent States, urging them to
accept the supremacy of the British and to cease fighting
amongst themselves. Letters were also sent to the chiefs
of Karenni, offering friendship and suggesting a meeting.</p>

<p>After the dispersal of the bands at Kugyo, the Limbin
Confederacy had withdrawn their troops and the Confederate
chiefs had retired to their own territories. The
Limbin had betaken himself to a place near Hopong.
Nevertheless there was no sign of the Eastern States
giving in and dissolving the Confederacy. Letters were
again written to them. A special letter was addressed to
the Limbin, promising him his liberty if he surrendered,
with a sufficient pension and a house at Moulmein or
Rangoon.</p>

<p>While the results of these overtures were being awaited,
it became urgent to attend to the quarrel between Möngpai,
the most southerly of the Shan States, and Pobye, the
chief of Western Karenni, which adjoins Möngpai on the
south. A perennial feud existed between them, and at this
time had broken out with fresh energy. Both the combatants
had written to Mr. Hildebrand praying him to send
a British officer with a force to put a stop to the strife
which was ruining the country. In answer to this appeal
Mr. Scott, with a hundred Gurkhas under command of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Captain Pulley, was sent southward to Payagon, where the
Burmese garrison used to be stationed, and near which the
Möngpai Sawbwa had now made his residence. They made
the journey of seventy miles by boat down the Nam Pilu
River through a fertile and irrigated country, which had
evidently suffered much from both the contending factions.</p>

<p>The Sawbwa received Mr. Scott with hospitality and
welcomed the settlement of the Shan States under the
British Crown. He said he had prayed for this and urged it
on his compatriots for thirty years. "Now that the British
have come," he exclaimed, "there will be peace." He
asked for a British garrison at Payagon, as a protection
against the Karennis, who raided the Shan country for
slaves. The Shans were quite unable to withstand them,
and men and women were carried off into hopeless slavery
(<i>vide</i> Chapter XVII.).</p>

<p>It had been intended that the force under Colonel Stedman
should return to Burma by the southern passes to
Toungoo, and that Mr. Scott with the troops accompanying
him should remain at or about Möngpai until the main
body joined him. Owing to some military exigencies this
plan was changed, and the expedition was ordered to return
by the route by which it came. Captain Pulley with Mr.
Scott's escort was recalled at once to Fort Stedman. Mr.
Scott had to withdraw, leaving unsettled many matters,
more especially the quarrel between Möngpai and the
Karenni chief Pobye, and without waiting for several
headmen of neighbouring districts who were on their way
to meet him. This was unfortunate.</p>

<p>After the return of Mr. Scott and his escort to Fort
Stedman on the 7th of March, 1887, a long halt followed,
during which voluminous correspondence was carried on
with the various chiefs who held aloof and with the Limbin
Prince, who it was hoped might be induced to surrender
and thus dissolve the Confederacy. The Prince was
reported to be at Hopong. Letters were sent to him and
to Möngnai, and to Möngpawn, inviting them to meet Mr.
Hildebrand at Hopong on the 17th of March, and preparations
were made for the march. The difficulties of transport
had been overcome, the pack-bullock baskets loaded
up; the coolies collected, and everything ready for a start,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
when letters were received from Möngpawn saying that he
could not meet the Superintendent. Möngnai was at
Gantarawadi, the capital of Eastern Karenni, witnessing
the marriage of his nephew to a daughter of Sawlapaw,
the Karenni chief. Möngnai's sister-in-law had died. She
could not be buried until Möngnai returned. Until the
funeral was over Möngnai could not attend to business, and
without him the others could do nothing. Royalties are
governed by conventions.</p>

<p>It was obvious that Möngpawn's object was to gain time.
To countermand the march, now that all preparations had
been made and the forward movement widely made known
was open to many objections. The Yawnghwè Sawbwa
argued strongly against a change of plans, which he said
would certainly be misinterpreted. Mr. Hildebrand, however,
decided to countermand the march. He wished to
give the Confederacy full time to consider the alternatives
before them. He held that a voluntary acknowledgment
of British supremacy made from a conviction that it was
the best course for their own interests would be more
valuable even if it were delayed than an immediate submission
enforced by arms.</p>

<p>This waiting policy was not free from some disadvantages.
The delay in taking action was sure to be attributed to
weakness. The time was used by Sawlapawgyi, who was
hostile to the British, to urge the other Karenni chiefs and
those Shan Sawbwas with whom he could communicate to
hold aloof. In the neighbourhood of Yawnghwè and in the
Myélat States generally signs of unrest and trouble were
manifest. For the first time since the occupation of Fort
Stedman mail-runners were stopped and robbed. The
Sawbwa of Lawksawk, who remained openly and uncompromisingly
hostile, was thought to have instigated these
outrages. It was resolved to strike the first blow at him.
He was warned by letter that the Superintendent was
coming to Lawksawk and ordered to remain at his capital
to meet him.</p>

<p>The difficulty of collecting transport had to be overcome
again. The Yawnghwè Sawbwa for some cause was not
zealous in assisting the expedition. For one reason he
desired to make the most money he could out of the opportunity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and made a very persistent effort to extort exorbitant
rates for the carriage furnished.</p>

<p>It was not until the 4th of April that the force began to
march for Lawksawk. It moved by very easy stages. The
various bands of marauders posted along the route to harass
the march fled as the expedition advanced. These ruffians
had been working in concert with dacoit gangs in the districts
below the hills, who had thus been able to resist the
British troops; but now, finding themselves liable to be
taken in the rear, very soon surrendered to the military post
at Wundwin, an unexpected but very useful result of Mr.
Hildebrand's action. Before the column reached Lawksawk
the Sawbwa Saw Waing fled. The town was occupied
on the 11th of April. Temporary arrangements were
made for administering the State by putting in charge a
Burman, Bo Saing, who had held office under the King's
Government and was acceptable to the people, and the
force turned its face towards Hopong.</p>

<p>Meanwhile fighting had been renewed in the south-east.
Möngnai returned from Karenni with some men lent to him
by Sawlapaw and drove Twet Nga Lu out of Kengtawng.
Laikha, Möngkung, and Kehsi Mansam, who had been
invited by Mr. Hildebrand to come to Hoypong to meet
Möngnai and Möngpawn with a view to their reconciliations,
put their own interpretation on this invitation and
attacked Möngpawn in force. Peremptory orders were
sent to them to withdraw. When the force entered
Hopong on the 17th of April, the day appointed for meeting
Möngpawn and the Limbin Prince, the town was found
in ruins and all but deserted. The Limbin had not come,
and Möngpawn was occupied in defending himself against
his enemies. The intelligence received showed that Laikha
and his allies had not obeyed the order to withdraw their
men. Finding that an engagement was in progress a few
miles off, Mr. Hildebrand and Mr. Scott with forty Mounted
Infantry and fifty Punjabis under Major Swetenham rode
for the scene of the fight, which went on for a short time
unchecked by the arrival of the British party. The opposing
forces had stockaded positions on the opposite slopes of
a small valley, and were firing briskly on each other. Möngpawn
was induced to cease firing. The Assistant Superintendent,
Mr. Scott, went up to the stockade of the attacking
party, and the leaders were soon persuaded to withdraw
their men, who for their part were only too glad to go to
their homes. When the British retired to Möngpawn in
the evening, they left the opposing leaders mingled together
in good-humoured talk, bragging of the desperate deeds of
valour performed in the combat.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Padaung Ladies&mdash;Shan States.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>
<p>A few days were spent at Möngpawn. The Sawbwa
Hkun Ti is described as a man of strong character, "the
moving spirit in the Limbin Confederacy." He was quite
ready, however, to give up this coalition and to transfer
his allegiance to the Queen-Empress. He advised the
despatch of a party to Möngnai to hoist the British flag
and to bring in the Limbin Prince. The rains were now
well on, and marching had become very difficult. It was
decided, therefore, not to take the whole force but to send
the Assistant Superintendent with fifty rifles under Lieutenant
Wallace to Möngnai. The Superintendent with the
main body marched back to Fort Stedman.</p>

<p>Mr. Scott was detained for some days in Möngpawn
waiting for rations. The time was well employed. Two
of the minor chiefs, Naungmawn (a brother of Möngpawn)
and Möngsit (Möngpawn's son-in-law, and half-brother
of Mawknai), came and tendered their allegiance. Others
offered their submission by messenger and promised to
meet the Assistant Superintendent at Möngnai, which they
said was the place of assemblage for the Shan States from
ancient times. More than this, very friendly relations
were established during this halt between the people and
the troops. The <i>Myozas</i> (headmen) from the neighbouring
villages came round every evening for rifle-practice with
the officers; and it is recorded that Möngpawn and his
brother made very good shooting. The troops were paraded
and man&oelig;uvred for their entertainment. Notwithstanding
these courtesies, however, no promise to surrender the
Limbin Prince could be obtained from these chiefs. "It
must depend," they said, "on his own decision." They
suggested that better terms should be offered to him. "This
was an instance," says Mr. Hildebrand, "of the way in
which the Shan chiefs cling together, and of the sanctity
they attach to an oath." Although the Limbin's cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and the ideas on which it was based were hopelessly lost,
they would not coerce him to surrender.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of May Mr. Scott's party began their march,
and entered Möngnai on the 5th, having suffered from
heavy and incessant rain all the way. After crossing the
Mewettaung Range, they entered a level valley which extends
to Kengtawng on the south-east and up northward as far
as Laikha. The altitude of this valley is about 4,000 feet.
It is the centre of the silk cultivation, the eggs and larvæ
being imported periodically from the Chinese provinces
of Yunnan and Szechuen. When the party passed through
the whole district had been ravaged by men from Laikha,
and only a few almost empty villages survived. Twet Nga
Lu from Kengtawng had also been at work, and on the
last march of seventeen miles into Möngnai most of the
villages were found in ruins. They had been burnt by
his marauders two months before.</p>

<p>The description of Möngnai at this time is worth quoting
(Mr. Hildebrand's Report, June 22, 1887, par. 97).</p>

<p>"From the north there is a long avenue-like approach
to Möngnai. The walls of the ancient city still exist in
a very dilapidated state. They are about 20 feet high
and machicolated. The city was about 1,000 yards square,
and there remain signs of extensive suburbs. Everything,
however, has been destroyed. Of ten thousand houses only
three hundred (mostly recently built) remain; out of one
hundred and twenty monasteries only three are left standing.
The Sawbwa himself lives in a bamboo house, instead
of the former teak-wood <i>haw</i> (palace). The interior of the
city walls is all jungle-grown."</p>

<p>It is as well to put on record some description of the
condition in which the British found the Shan States. A few
years hence we shall be denounced as the ruthless destroyers
of a country which we had found wealthy and prosperous.</p>

<p>The Sawbwa of Möngnai came in unpretentious fashion
to see Mr. Scott the day after his arrival. His superiority
in breeding and character to most of the chiefs was marked,
He made no difficulty about accepting British supremacy,
and proffered all his influence to induce the other chiefs
to follow his example. The typical character of the Shans
as a race of traders came out in his request that his submission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to British authority should be made known in
Moulmein. In former times there was a good trade in
timber with the Moulmein merchants. When they were
informed of the establishment of peace this trade he anticipated
would revive.</p>

<p>It remained to induce the Limbin Prince to submit
and to accompany Mr. Scott to Fort Stedman. This was
not a question of very high diplomacy, but it required some
skill, tact, and patience to induce the Prince to make a
voluntary surrender. It would have been very easy to
have arrested and removed him by force. Such action,
however, would have been distasteful to the Shan chiefs
and might have rendered it more difficult to dispose of
other pretenders still remaining in the Northern States.
The Prince showed himself to be a poor creature, whose
chief characteristic was an immeasurable conceit. He was,
after all, only the illegitimate son of the Ein-she-min, or
War Prince, who was the brother of King Mindon. But
Burmans and Shans, like some other people, if a man
is a prince, do not ask too curiously what sort of a prince
he may be. When he left Möngnai, mounted on an
elephant, with his gong beating, great numbers of people
knelt down by the roadside as he passed, and similar respect
was shown to him at other places. Notwithstanding his
conceit, he did not put a very high price on his submission.
This descendant of kings, who had left his refuge in
British Burma to become the head of a great Shan Confederacy
to be formed on the model of the German Empire,
was glad to barter his lofty ambition for a stipend of £16
sterling a month and a house at Rangoon, or Moulmein,
or elsewhere.</p>

<p>While the Prince was making arrangements for the
journey, the Assistant Superintendent with Lieutenant
Wallace, 27th Punjab Infantry, and Lieutenant Jackson,
R.E., rode to Mawkmai, some twenty-five miles over rolling
country covered with scrub-oak forest. They found Mawkmai
situated in a fine valley 120 miles in extent, irrigated
from the Nam Nyim River, and well cultivated; the
main crop being paddy. The town was in good order,
well built and prosperous. "The one town," records Mr.
Scott, "in the Shan States that has not been destroyed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the inter-State wars." The trade relations between Mawkmai
and Moulmein are close; the Salween in the rainy
season being navigable and affording good means of
communication.</p>

<p>The British officers were received with courtesy and
hospitality by the Sawbwa and his officials. The suzerainty
of the Queen-Empress was accepted as a matter of course.
The only anxiety of the chief was in respect of the duty
likely to be imposed on exported timber, which had been
severely taxed by King Thebaw.</p>

<p>On the 11th of May the party returned to Möngnai. The
attitude of the Sawbwa Kun Kyi was excellent. He assured
Mr. Scott that he would be able to promise the submission
of the Trans-Salween States, who all looked to him as
their leader, and to Möngnai as their place of assemblage.
He asked as a special favour to himself, and as a confirmation
of his authority, that he might be allowed to fly the
British flag over his residence. This request was granted.
In the evening the British officers with a small guard of
honour went to the Sawbwa's <i>haw</i>, or palace, where a
flagstaff had been prepared, and the Union Jack was run
up by Mr. Scott, the bugles sounding a general salute
and the troops presenting arms. A great number of
people from Möngnai and the neighbouring villages were
present. They saluted the flag in their customary attitude of
respect, on their knees, and when the troops marched off
the Sawbwa's band struck up. What march it played
has not been recorded.</p>

<p>The Limbin Prince had now made his arrangements
for the journey, and on the 13th the party started for
Fort Stedman, which was reached on the 20th of May. The
route lay over a road which had not been used for a year
and which the contending parties had endeavoured to make
impassable. Four sepoys and several camp-followers were
spiked in the feet. But for this mishap the three weeks'
march from Möngpawn round by Möngnai would have been
accomplished without having a single man on the sick-list;
and this although there had been much rain, especially
on the return journey. After five days' rest the Limbin
Prince was sent under escort to the plains, and passed
into obscurity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 22nd of June the Superintendent was able to report
from Fort Stedman: "The Southern Shan States have now
all given in their submission; caravans of cattle and pedlars
move about from State to State with perfect freedom and
confidence, a condition of things which has hardly existed
since the accession of King Thebaw in 1879." (Mr. Hildebrand's
Report, June 22, 1887, par. 147.)</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

THE SHAN STATES (<i>continued</i>)</h2>


<p>The narrative in the last chapter took the history down
to the end of June, 1887, when comparative peace
had been established in the Southern States.</p>

<p>The Northern States up to this time had not come
under the influence of the Superintendent at Fort Stedman.
The Chief Commissioner had decided that no expedition
should be sent into those States until after the rains of
1887, unless it became absolutely necessary for the support
of the friendly Sawbwa of Hsipaw. The chief had been able,
as has been explained (p. 147), with the alliance of San
Ton Hon to hold his own and to defeat their opponents
headed by Naw Möng and the Chaunggwa Prince. If
he had stopped at that point much misery and destruction
would have been saved. But Hkun Saing's vanity had
been inflated by the reception he had received at Mandalay
when ten years' revenue had been remitted to him and
the States of Möngtung, Manglön, and Hsumhsai made
over to him, and he cherished visions of further aggrandisement.
San Ton Hon was very much of the same
mind.</p>

<p>After defeating the Prince they turned their forces
southward and made an attack on Hsenwi Alelet, where
comparative peace had been maintained by the Pa-ôk-Chok
at Möngyai. San Ton Hon led his troops down by
the east while Hsipaw's men, under the Sawbwa's father-in-law,
went by the west. Mr. Hildebrand had heard of
their designs and sent them orders to desist. The allies
persisted, however, alleging that they were acting under
instructions from Mandalay. Möngyai was occupied. The
Pa-ôk-Chok and Naw Möng, who was with him, escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
to Möngnawng and sent messengers to Fort Stedman
praying for redress. They were ordered to remain quiet
until the Superintendent should come to Hsenwi. San
Ton Hon remained in Möngyai making arrangements for
administering the district. He then left for the town
of Hsenwi in obedience to a further order from Mr.
Hildebrand. By the end of August, 1887, peace had been
restored, that is to say, active fighting had ceased in the
Northern States, and the contending parties awaited
the coming of the Superintendent to settle their claims.
Little harm would have resulted from the turbulence of
Hsipaw and San Ton Hon if they had restrained their
followers from ravaging the country. These bandits, San
Ton Hon's Kachins at the head of them, had burnt
and destroyed everything. Thus the autumn of 1887 saw
the cessation of bloodshed in both the Northern and
Southern States. All were beginning to look to the British
representative at Fort Stedman as the final arbitrator
of disputes, and trade began to revive.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the objects to be aimed at and the measures
to be taken in the ensuing open season of 1887-8 were
occupying the Chief Commissioner. Mr. Hildebrand was
invited to Mandalay, and the subject was fully discussed
and settled in consultation with him. The main lines of
the policy to be followed in relation to the States
were defined. The conditions upon which the chiefs
were to hold their States under the British Government
were determined and embodied in a patent, or <i>sanad</i>, to
use the Indian term, for the greater chiefs, and in a
letter of appointment for the lesser. By the <i>sanad</i> the
recipient was recognized as a feudatory chief and empowered
to govern his territories in all matters whether
criminal, civil, or revenue, and was authorized to
nominate for the approval of the Government a fit person
according to Shan usage to be his successor. These privileges
were made subject to certain conditions, one of which was
the payment of a tribute, settled for five years at the
amount previously paid to the King, and liable to revision
thereafter. The forests and royalties on all minerals
and precious stones were reserved to the Government.
Order was to be maintained by the chief, the rights and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
customs of the people were to be respected, and trade
protected. All disputes arising between one State and
another were to be referred to the Superintendent, at whose
headquarters the chief was to maintain an agent or representative.
The order of appointment given to the lesser
men bound them to pay the revenue assessed by
the Superintendent, and in all matters connected with the
administration of their districts to conform to the instructions
and orders issued by the Chief Commissioner or the
Superintendent.</p>

<p>It was decided that each chief or ruler, whether known
by the title of Sawbwa or some lesser designation, should
be required to appear in person, to make a declaration
of allegiance, and to subscribe to the terms of his <i>sanad</i>.
Where there were rival claimants, weight was to be given
to the <i>fait accompli</i>, and to considerations of expediency
rather than to those of abstract right or justice. It was
not held incumbent on the British Government to go
behind existing facts or to inquire how the man in
possession came by his power, provided he appeared to
be a person capable of maintaining order.</p>

<p>Some matters of importance hitherto unsettled were
decided by the Chief Commissioner at this time. The
important State of Lawksawk had been left in temporary
charge of a Burman Myoôk (<i>vide</i> page 154). There was
a man named Hkun Nu who had been the (hereditary)
Myoza of a small State called Tabet by the Burmans,
Tamhpak by the Shans. He had been deposed about 1892
by the Burman Government because he could not raise
the revenue demanded from the State. He lived in great
poverty in Mandalay until the deposition of the King. His
case coming to the Chief Commissioner's notice, a small
allowance, enough to keep him alive, was made to him.
Hkun Nu proved himself useful in giving information about
the Shan country and in taking letters, not without some
personal risk, to various potentates. He accompanied the
expedition to the Shan States early in 1887, and was found
by Mr. Hildebrand to be both intelligent and trustworthy
and to be a person of some influence in the Shan country.
On Mr. Hildebrand's recommendation, and with the goodwill
of many of the notables of Lawksawk, and of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of the principal Sawbwas such as Möngnai and Möngpawn,
he was appointed by the Chief Commissioner to be Sawbwa
of Lawksawk, a territory of 4,048 square miles and paying
a gross revenue of Rs. 27,297. Thus from being the dismissed
magistrate of a petty district, earning a small wage
as a guide and messenger, Hkun Nu became the ruler of
a considerable and wealthy State by a sudden turn of the
wheel of fortune. It may be recorded here that the State
prospered under him. On his death in 1900 he was
succeeded by his son, who was summoned to Rangoon in
1906, and presented to their Royal Highnesses the Prince
and Princess of Wales. He received the decoration of
K.S.M. on the 1st of January, 1907, and has done much
in the way of road-making and otherwise to improve his
country.</p>

<p>Another matter that came up was the Sawbwa of
Möngnai's claim to the adjacent State of Kengtawng, which
had been made over by the Burmese Government to Twet
Nga Lu. Orders were now passed confirming the Sawbwa's
title to administer Kengtawng as a State subordinate
to him.</p>

<p>Many important questions remained, which could not
be settled until the Superintendent was able to visit each
State with a sufficient military escort to mark his authority
and to render opposition improbable. Hsenwi was in a
disturbed and distracted condition and had to be pacified
and arrangements made for its administration. The method
in which the group of smaller States on the western edge
of the plateau known as the Myélat was to be administered
had also to be considered and decided. The nearness of
these States to Mandalay had resulted in diminishing their
independence. Their position was in fact not much different
from that of a purely Burman district. Then there
were the Trans-Salween States, with which communication
had not as yet been established. Five of the smallest
of these had been claimed by the Siamese. Another
very difficult matter was the attitude of the Karennis,
whose relations with the British Government it was
necessary to define. In the case of every State, big or
little, the amount paid as revenue during the King's time
had to be ascertained, the tribute payable to the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Government to be determined, and engagements to be
taken for its regular payment.</p>

<p>In Mr. Hildebrand's expedition in the beginning of 1887
only one force had been employed. Experience showed
that the area to be dealt with was too large for one column.
While the force was in the south, fighting and disturbances
were going on in the north. The appearance of two
expeditions, one starting from Mandalay and visiting the
north, the other from Fort Stedman, taking the Southern
States and then moving up to combine with the first, would
make a greater impression than a single force of much
larger strength. Rumour would magnify the numbers of
each, and if opposition were contemplated by any of the
chiefs, he would not know where to direct his attack.
For these reasons it was decided to employ two columns.
The larger, under command of Major Swetenham, 27th
P.I., was composed of:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">

<p>It assembled at Fort Stedman, and was called the Southern
Shan Column.</p>

<p>The smaller column was commanded by Major Yates,
1-1 Eastern Division, R.A., and included the following
troops:&mdash;</p>

</table></div>

<p>This column was designated the Northern Shan Column.
Its starting-point was Maymyo (Pyinulwin), forty miles
from Mandalay.</p>

<p>To Mr. Hildebrand, as Superintendent of the Shan States,
was given the chief political charge, and, within certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
limits laid down by the Chief Commissioner, the movements
of the columns and the measures to be taken for the
pacification of the country were left to his discretion. He
was to accompany the Southern Column, and Mr. J. G.
Scott was appointed to go with him as his Assistant.
Lieutenant H. Daly was posted as civil officer with the
Northern Column. In all political matters he was placed
entirely under Mr. Hildebrand, and was told that he
was to act, and only to act, under his instructions.</p>

<p>The relations of Mr. Hildebrand to the military
officers in command of the columns were carefully
defined. The primary object of the expeditions was to
establish peace, decide disputes, and lay the foundations
of orderly rule for the future. The need of warlike
operations was not anticipated. The military officers
commanding were instructed therefore to give to the civil
officers every assistance in carrying out the wishes of
Government that could be given with due regard to the
safety and well-being of the troops. In the event of
hostilities becoming necessary, then the civil officer was
to stand aside while the soldiers became solely responsible
for the planning and carrying out of the necessary operations.
The maintenance of the strictest discipline was
enjoined, and the most scrupulous exactitude in paying
for labour and supplies. Troops and followers were
made to understand that they were operating in a friendly
country.</p>

<p>Instructions were given to Mr. Hildebrand as to the
route to be taken by each column, the matters demanding
his attention, and the principles by which he was to be
guided. Mr. Daly with the Northern Column was to
move through Hsipaw to Northern Hsenwi, then to
Tawngpeng, the chief of which State was still recalcitrant;
and thence returning to Hsipaw, he was to
march to Möngyai in Central Hsenwi.</p>

<p>Mr. Hildebrand with the Southern Column was to go
to Möngpai, thence to Mawkmai, thence to Möngpan,
and then to Möngnai, which was a convenient centre for
the settlement of many matters. After a halt there, which
it was anticipated might extend to several weeks, the
column was to turn northward and march through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
intervening States to Möngyai, which it was to reach about
the same time as the Northern Column. The idea was
to bring the two columns together in Hsenwi, where the
contending parties of San Ton Hon, Naw Hpa, Naw
Möng and Nga Aw the Pa-ôk-Chok, whom San Ton Hon
and the Hsipaw Sawbwa had expelled from Möngyai, were
expected to give trouble. At Möngyai, the settlement
of the large State of Hsenwi&mdash;the most difficult, perhaps,
of the duties entrusted to Mr. Hildebrand&mdash;would have to
be taken in hand.</p>

<p>The Southern Column started on the 22nd of November,
1887, on its five months' march through the States.
Before it moved, the chiefs of the Myélat and the Sawbwas
and Myozas of States in the neighbourhood of Fort
Stedman, were called in; the revenue to be paid by each
was fixed, and the drafts of their <i>sanads</i> and letters of
appointment given to them. There was no difficulty with
any of them except Saw Ôn, the Sawbwa of Yawnghwè,
who owed his position to the support afforded to him by
the British Government. He objected to the payment of
revenue, and feigned illness to avoid appearing before the
Superintendent. He made it almost impossible to get
coolies or bullocks, except directly through him and at
most exorbitant rates. He exhibited, in fact, a fine example
of a swollen head. But it may be that he partly believed
in the truth of some absurd stories respecting the withdrawal
of the British from Burma, which he was found
afterwards to have spread abroad.</p>

<p>The first halt was made at Kaung-i, the residence of the
Möngpai Sawbwa. The settlement of the chronic feud
between him and Pobye, the Karenni chief, was the main
business here. Pobye appeared, and the Superintendent
heard both parties. After vainly endeavouring to bring
them to an agreement, Mr. Hildebrand induced them to
pledge themselves to abide by the Chief Commissioner's
decision, and meanwhile to keep the peace. At a later
date, they submitted their case at Rangoon to the Chief
Commissioner, who settled the dispute....</p>

<p>At Möngpai every effort was made without success to
induce Sawlapaw, the powerful chief of Eastern Karenni,
to come in and arrange a <i>modus vivendi</i> with the British
authorities. He remained obstinately hostile, and had
to be chastised later on.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>
<p>At this halt, where several chiefs were assembled, the
principle of succession ruling in the Shan States was
discussed. It appeared that as a rule succession devolved
on the eldest son of the chief wife: failing her male
issue, on the eldest male issue of the next wife. Failing
heirs in the direct line, the succession went to collaterals.
This was shown to be the ancient custom not to be
departed from except in the case of obvious unfitness of
the heir for the duties of his position either from incapacity
or from vice. In Loilong and Hsahtung some questions
relating to minor chiefships were settled. It was found
that on this south-western frontier of the Shan States
the inhabitants were mostly Karens and kindred races
split up into small tribes speaking different dialects, timid
and shy people submitting to the tyranny of dacoits
and outlaws who sought a refuge in their hills from the
pursuit of the police and troops in the low country.</p>

<p>The column marched through the Mawkmai territory to
Möngpan. No special matter had been marked for settlement
in Mawkmai. But it was noted that the villagers in
the south stood in great fear of Sawlapaw, and paid blackmail
to him. Work in the forests of Southern and South-eastern
Mawkmai had been stopped on account of the
hostility of the Karenni chief. The adjacent country was
practically deserted, and the complaints against Sawlapaw
were loud. Mawkmai, however, at this time was the most
wealthy and prosperous of the Shan States, and the Sawbwa
seemed powerful enough to hold his own against any of his
neighbours.</p>

<p>From Mawkmai the column went on to Möngpan. Here
they met the Siamese Commissioners and Mr. Archer, His
Majesty's Acting Vice-Consul at Chiengmai (Zimme), who
had come to discuss the claim made by the Bangkok Government
to some small States east of the Salween. Möngpan
had been taken and burnt by the filibuster Twet Nga Lu,
who had so far recognized British authority that after his
expulsion from Kengtawng by Kun Kyi, the Möngnai
Sawbwa, he came to Fort Stedman and laid his claim before
the Superintendent. It was considered and rejected by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Chief Commissioner. Thereupon he collected a regiment
of <i>bravi</i>, as numerous in the Shan States in 1887 as in Italy
of the Middle Ages, and descending on Kengtawng burnt
whatever had escaped former devastations. Compelled to
retreat by the Sawbwa's men, he retired south on Möngpan,
and captured it in December, 1887. Again driven out by
the Möngnai troops, he fell back beyond the Salween, the
Möngnai men following him. But as the pursuit led them
into the territory of Möngtung and Möng Hang, which
were claimed by the Siamese, they were ordered by the
Superintendent to retire to the right bank of the Salween.
Twet Nga Lu was left encamped close to Möngtung, where
a small Siamese garrison was stationed, and he thus escaped
for the time. He was proclaimed a rebel and dacoit and
every chief in the Shan States was desired to treat him as
an outlaw. This was the situation at Möngpan when the
Southern Column met Mr. Archer and the Siamese Commissioners
at that place.</p>

<p>The four States in dispute with Siam were Möngtung,
Möng Hang, Möng Hta, and Möng Kyawt. They were
claimed by the British Government as part of the undoubtedly
Burman State Möngpan, but had been occupied
secretly by the Siamese. A fifth, Möng Hsat, was also
claimed by them, but no garrison had been placed in it. It
was and always had been a dependency of Kengtung, with
which the Siamese could not pretend to have any connection.
The Siamese claim had its origin in the conduct of the local
rulers (<i>Phayas</i>) of these little territories in the disturbed
times following the overthrow of King Thebaw.</p>

<p>The Mawkmai Sawbwa made a successful attack on Möngpan
in the cold season of 1886-7. Earlier in the same
year the Siamese had moved up a large force from Chiengmai,
ostensibly to assist the British in maintaining order:
more probably in the hope of picking up some fragments
for themselves when the Burman Government went to
pieces. Under these circumstances the local rulers,
threatened with burning and robbery by Mawkmai, with
invasion and slavery by Siam, sought the protection of the
more powerful Siamese and drank the water of allegiance to
Chiengmai. This was the only foundation for the claim
made by the Bangkok Government. Their assertion that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the States had been under Siam for a century had nothing
to support it. The population was admittedly Shan. A
report of the facts was drawn up and sent to the Chief
Commissioner. Meanwhile a <i>modus vivendi</i> was arranged
by Mr. Hildebrand with the Siamese Commissioner on the
basis of maintaining the <i>status quo</i>, preserving peace, and
abstaining from working the forests in the States until the
dispute was settled by the Governments of the two countries.
It may be stated here that a decision in favour of the British
claim was announced in 1888 and effect given to it. Four
States were restored to Möngpan, and possession of the
fifth, Möng Hsat, confirmed to Kengtung.</p>

<p>The State of Möngpan contains a broad area of good paddy
land, and in former times exported large quantities of paddy.
When Mr. Hildebrand visited it he found the lands devastated.
With the one exception of Laikha it had suffered
more than any other Shan State. The town had been
repeatedly burnt by filibusters. The great bulk of the
population had fled over the Salween and scattered through
the smaller States, some even going as far as Chiengmai
(Zimme) and Kengtung. Leaving Möngpan, the column
reached Möngnai on the 7th of January, 1888, and halted
there for some weeks. Möngnai had been the place of
assemblage of the Cis-Salween chiefs in the King's time.
All of them had been warned in advance to meet Mr.
Hildebrand at Möngnai, and all except the Sawbwa of
Laikha, the Myozas of Möng Kung and Kehsi Mansam,
who had started too late, were present. The chiefs
assembled at Möngnai were:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The Möngnai Sawbwa.<br />
The Möngpawn Sawbwa.<br />
The Möngpan Sawbwa.<br />
The Mawkmai Sawbwa.<br />
The Wanyin Myoza.<br />
The Nawng Wawn Myoza.<br />
The Hsahtung Myoza.<br />
The Möngsit Myoza.<br />
The Möngnawng Myoza.<br />
The Hopong Myoza.<br />
The Keng Hkam Myoza.<br />
The Nam Hkok Myoza.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Naw Möng, son of Naw Hpa, who was claimant of
Hsenwi, and Kun Aw, who was Pa-ôk-Chok of Möngyai
in Hsenwi Alelet, and had been ejected by San Ton Hon
and Hkun Sa, the exiled chief of Möngtung, were also
present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>The question of tribute was one in which all took
a keen interest, and it was fully discussed. The right of
the British Government to demand tribute was not contested.
But the manner of it, whether it should be in the
form of annual presents or of money to be raised from
the people by a house tax, was the subject of dispute. The
exemption for ten years which had been given to the Sawbwa
of Hsipaw caused much heartburning and led to demands
for a similar indulgence.</p>

<p>Eventually, however, all agreed to pay tribute, the amount
for the next five years being that which had been paid
yearly in King Mindon's time.</p>

<p>The Trans-Salween States from various causes did not
appear at Möngnai. But a dispute between Mawkmai and
Möngnai regarding the right to a small Trans-Salween
State of Möng Pu was settled satisfactorily in favour of
Möngnai. Mawkmai's claim had no strong foundation,
and after the facts had been set forth, the Sawbwa accepted
them and yielded in a peaceable and graceful fashion. It
was evident that already the authority of the British
Government had been acknowledged by all, and that its
decisions would be obeyed.</p>

<p>On the 20th of January Mr. Hildebrand held a Durbar,
which all the chiefs, and a very great number of the smaller
folk, attended. The draft patents and letters of appointment
were given to the chiefs, along with suitable presents, and
the advantages of the peace which would follow the establishment
of British authority were pointed out to them by
the Superintendent in a speech. A march past and a sham-fight
by the troops gave them an opportunity of comparing
British disciplined and trained troops with their own disorderly
and ill-equipped followers. Sports followed the
Durbar, affording amusement to all and giving a common
ground on which all could unite. The wisdom and the
excellent results of holding these meetings cannot be
denied.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of January, 1888, the column left Möngnai
and started on its way to Möngyai, where it will be recollected
(p. 166) it was to meet with the Northern Column
and Mr. Daly. The route to be taken on this march had
been left by the Chief Commissioner to Mr. Hildebrand's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
discretion. Is has been seen that the Laikha group of
States were not represented at the Durbar. The Superintendent,
therefore, instead of taking the route to the east
through Möngnawng, which was reputed to be the shorter,
took a western road leading through Laikha, Möng Kung,
and Kehsi Mansam. It proved to be the easiest route that
could have been followed, and showed the troops to as large
a number of States as possible.</p>

<p>On the second march out the Sawbwa of Laikha and the
Myoza of Möng Kung were met coming to meet the Superintendent.
They turned and marched with the column.
They said that difficulties in procuring supplies had delayed
them, and the truth of this statement was proved by the
appearance of the countryside when the next march brought
the force into Laikha territory&mdash;a wide billowy plain not
long ago closely cultivated and well peopled: now deserted
and waste. "The face of the land," wrote the Superintendent,
"was deserted and desolate as an American pampas
or a Russian steppe. We marched along the main north
road which had clearly been not long since a wide thoroughfare
travelled over by many men and many cattle. Now it
was narrowed to a mere path which encroaching bushes and
rank grass threatened at no great distance of time altogether
to obliterate. Marks of tigers were seen here and there on
the clay trodden hard by the feet of many wayfarers now no
more to be seen. The few householders who remained were
gaunt with hunger, and had not energy enough left to pull
up the bamboo spikes which had been placed in the ground
during the fighting which was the primary cause of all this
misery, emphasized by the famine which succeeded as a
necessary result. The Hsen (local headman) spiked his foot
coming out to meet the column."</p>

<p>The description of the town of Laikha is not less melancholy.
It has been on the decline for years. "Civil wars
and local disturbances have ruined it slowly but surely."
It was one of the finest and wealthiest places in the State,
and there were many splendid monasteries and elaborate
pagodas. These were found deserted and falling to pieces,
the shrines left to moulder away without a single pious
offering, the jungle coming up to their very thresholds and
creepers tearing the bricks asunder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving Laikha on the 30th of January, three marches
brought the column to Möngkung, a State blessed with
very fertile soil and good streams. But here also local
dissension and Burman interference had brought ruin. On
the death of the chief (designated <i>Myoza</i>), one Hkun Saing
was able by bribery or intrigue to procure an order from
Mandalay giving him the succession. The people, however,
clung to the rightful heir, the son of the deceased Myoza, a
boy of ten or twelve. Hkun Sang persuaded the neighbouring
State of Möngnawng to take his part. Kehsi Mansam
took the boy's side. Nearly every village in both States
was burnt, and the able-bodied men were too absorbed in
the fight to till the soil. Ruin and famine followed in the
track of the fighting, which did not cease until our troops
arrived on the Shan plateau. The only villages to which
any prosperity remained were those in the hills inhabited
by tribes of a Karen origin who held aloof from Shan
politics. At Möngkung the minor chief of Möngsang and
Mönghsu came to see the Superintendent. Here also news
came that Mr. Daly with the Northern Column had reached
Hsenwi and had received from San Ton Hon a promise
that he would come to Möngyai. This hopeful information
regarding San Ton Hon enabled the Superintendent to
issue a proclamation in Shan to the monks, headmen, and
elders of Hsenwi, assuring them that a settlement of their
affairs would certainly be made and ordering them to attend
at Möngyai.</p>

<p>From Möngkung to Kehsi Mansam was four marches
through a country marked by the ravages of war. Nevertheless
the Myoza, "an undersized, insignificant-looking
creature, addicted to the use of opium," was not too depressed
to come out fifteen miles to meet the column, which
he played into the town with a band of local musicians and
dancers leading the way.</p>

<p>Matters relating to some minor States were discussed
at Kehsi Mansam, and the peaceful settlement of Hsenwi
seemed not distant. But it was sanguine to expect that
people who had been engaged in petty wars for years would
take suddenly to the ways of peace. The lion does not all
at once lie down with the lamb, nor it might be said more
appropriately does the jackal make peace with the wild dog.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Two days after the arrival of the column at Kehsi Mansam
it was reported that an attack had been made on Möngyai
and San Ton Hon's deputy driven out. The men who
headed this adventure were nephews of the Pa-ôk-Chok
and gave out that they were acting for that personage with
the Superintendent's approval. As the Pa-ôk-Chok and
Naw Möng had accompanied the force ever since it marched
from Möngnai, it was feared that this story might seem
probable to San Ton Hon and might prevent him from
coming to Möngyai. Letters, therefore, were sent to
reassure him and to explain that the expulsion of his
man from Möngyai would not influence the decision of
the Superintendent.</p>

<p>From Kehsi Mansam, passing through the Alelet or
Central Division of Hsenwi, the column reached Möngyai
on the 15th of February, 1888. Mr. Daly, with the
Northern Column, joined Mr. Hildebrand on the 1st of
March. Kun San Ton Hon came with him. Meanwhile
all the headmen of various denominations, uncouth to
English ears, Myozas, Heins, Seins, Ta Möngs, and Kin
Möngs, had collected in obedience to the Superintendent's
summons, and were busy no doubt in discussing the situation
and the best methods of settlement and comparing the
present condition of the State broken up into petty
divisions, none of them powerful enough for self-defence,
with the comparative order which had prevailed when it
was under its hereditary Sawbwas, who could show an
unbroken succession for two hundred years.</p>

<p>On the 1st of March, when San Ton Hon arrived with
Mr. Daly, all the Hsenwi claimants were assembled at
Möngyai. Naw Möng&mdash;representing his father, Naw Hpa,
who was a refugee with the Kachins in the north; Sang Aw,
the Pa-ôk-Chok, who claimed the Central Division; and San
Ton Hon, who claimed the whole State. Naw Hpa was
pronounced on all sides to be too old and infirm to rule.
Naw Möng claimed as his heir and representative the whole
of Hsenwi, excepting some of the southern subdivisions,
which had been given independence in the King's time.
His attitude was most reasonable. He confessed his obligations
to the British Government. Unless they had occupied
Mandalay and removed Thebaw, he and his sister would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
have been lying still in hopeless imprisonment. He was
ready to bow to the Superintendent's decision, whatever it
might be. The Pa-ôk-Chok was even more accommodating.
He was an old worn man whose only title to be considered
in the matter was that he had preserved the peace in the
Central Division at a critical time. He would be quite content
if he were permitted to administer Möngyai. San Ton
Hon, who had no rightful title to any part of Hsenwi, not
unnaturally laid claim to all the country that was or had
been known by that name. On reflection, however, he
adopted an attitude of greater humility and declared his
willingness to abide by the decision of the Superintendent.</p>

<p>The points to which the Superintendent's inquiry should
be directed had been laid down by the Chief Commissioner
in the instructions given him. Amongst other points, such
as the history of the several claimants, their sources of
influence and their ability and power to govern, the Chief
Commissioner had laid stress on the real wishes of the
people of Hsenwi as a whole or of such parts of it as
should be separately considered. "You should then," he
wrote, "pending a full reference to the Chief Commissioner,
make such arrangements for the administration of Theinni
[Hsenwi] as you deem most fitting, bearing in mind that
the great object to be attained is peace in the country. You
must not be guided either in your provisional arrangements
or in your recommendations solely by considerations of
abstract right or abstract justice. You must give great
weight to considerations of expediency and keep prominently
before your mind that Theinni [Hsenwi] must have
strong permanent Government in order to ensure peace and
prosperity; and that the chief or chiefs must be both
friendly to the British Government and ready and able to
give proof of friendship by prompt and powerful action
should such be necessary." The question whether the
policy should be to unite the country into one large State,
or to recognize the divisions into which it had been broken
up, was left to Mr. Hildebrand's discretion, but an inclination
in favour of the large State was indicated.</p>

<p>It was decided to hold a conference of all the persons
interested in this matter and to ascertain, so far as might
be possible, the views and wishes of the people. A large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
(<i>Mandat</i> or) temporary hall was constructed by the Pa-ôk-Chok
for the assemblage. On the date fixed, the 3rd of
March, 1888, "about fifty headmen of circles, many
superiors of monasteries, monks, sidesmen, almoners, and
village elders were assembled, while outside gathered great
numbers of the common people from all parts of the country.
There were also present beside the claimants, representatives
of all the chief Southern States and of Hsipaw."
In fact, it was an assemblage of all the estates of the realm
in the Shan country&mdash;the Lords Temporal, the Lords
Spiritual, and the Commons. They had come together to
assist in deciding by whom and how the Hsenwi territory
should be governed. And they had come at the call of a
Government which had taken a visible form in the Shan
country only a year before, which only two years previously
had displaced the King of Burma to whom the Shans had
been subject for centuries, and which was still fighting in
Burma proper against the adherents of the King. It was
certainly an achievement not easily matched in the history
of conquests or annexations, and showed the confidence in
our power and our justice which a very short experience had
been able to create.</p>

<p>It was not a mere show; the people had not assembled
themselves to register a foregone decision. The Superintendent
was making an honest attempt to ascertain the
wishes of all classes. The machinery was rude. But
it was quite as likely to succeed in its object as the elaborate
devices of advanced democracies which give free play to
the arts of false-tongued demagogues and afford them every
opportunity of bamboozling electors, most of whom are
more ignorant of the issues than the Shans who assembled
at Möngyai.</p>

<p>The method adopted for taking the votes was to call upon
each head of a circle to record his opinion, and then to take
the opinion of the assembly. The first question put was
whether Hsenwi should be reunited or whether it should
remain divided, and if divided, into how many parts. The
opinion against reunion into one State was manifested
unmistakably. On the second point there was much
discussion, but the result showed a balance, and a large
balance, of opinion in favour of two States, North and South.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
The great majority, when the question of the rulers to
be appointed was put, gave the North to San Ton Hon,
and the South to Naw Möng. The Pa-ôk-Chok did not
press his claim. "On the whole," the report says,
"considerable intelligence and a shrewd appreciation of
the novel idea of an open election were displayed, and
a member of the outside crowd created some amusement
by his vigorous championing of San Ton Hon. This
unexpected interlude had a very good effect in putting most
of the headmen at their ease and in persuading the entire
assemblage that the election was a perfectly open matter,
and that any one present might give his opinion and his
reasons for holding it." The Shans were evidently a
primitive people in election matters at least, and had to
learn the art of breaking up meetings and silencing
opponents.</p>

<p>After electing the Sawbwas of Northern and Southern
Hsenwi, the boundary to be fixed between the two
divisions was discussed and settled with the acquiescence
of San Ton Hon and Naw Möng, but against the views
of some of the latter's people, who thought that Southern
Hsenwi was shorn of some territory which ought to
belong to it.</p>

<p>Further disagreement between the Naw Möng and his
people followed when on the second day of the Durbar
the amount of revenue to be paid by the two divisions
respectively came to be considered. The Naw Möng offered
spontaneously to pay the sum formerly paid to the King
by the Alelet Division, without making any deduction on
account of the circles which the boundary now adopted had
given to the Northern territory. This easy attitude of their
newly appointed chief caused acute discontent, which
afterwards manifested itself. San Ton Hon was a man
of different stamp. The Naw Möng had offered a revenue
of Rs. 15,000. San Ton Hon made a stand against
paying more than Rs. 500. He agreed, after much talking,
to pay Rs. 2,000. The Northern Division of Hsenwi was
no doubt much poorer at the time than the South. Still
the amount was considerably less than the State ought to
have paid. The Superintendent, however, thought it wiser
to accept it than to risk a rupture with San Ton Hon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>The unequal treatment was impolitic as well as unfair
and bred trouble in Southern Hsenwi. A month after
the column left Möngyai a rising against Naw Möng was
organized by the discontented party, and he had to make
his escape by flight. Mr. Daly, who was at Hsipaw,
rode out at once with a small party and summoned all
the heads of circles to Möngyai. An inquiry was held,
the leaders of the revolt were arrested and tried by the
Sawbwa of South Hsenwi, and were sentenced to terms
of imprisonment. New headmen were appointed in place
of those condemned. Mr. Daly returned to Hsipaw, and
the Naw Möng had no further trouble to contend with.
The settlement of Hsenwi made at the Möngyai Durbar
has stood the test of time and is a monument to the
officers concerned in bringing it about.</p>

<p>Leaving Möngyai on the 7th of March, the column
marched to Lashio by easy stages.</p>

<p>Nothing has been said hitherto as to the Northern Shan
Column which accompanied Mr. Daly. Mr. Daly had
preceded the force to Hsipaw and made arrangements for
its progress. He had despatched letters to the Northern
chiefs announcing his coming, and reassuring them as to
the nature of the movement.</p>

<p>The route laid down for the Northern Shan Column
by the Chief Commissioner was from Hsipaw to the
northern part of Hsenwi; thence westward to Namhsan,
the chief town in Tawngpeng; then back to Hsipaw and
from Hsipaw on to Möngyai to meet the Southern Column.
No independent powers were given to Mr. Daly, who was
to place himself in all political matters under Mr.
Hildebrand's orders. He was to act as the precursor of the
Superintendent, summoning the chiefs and headmen and
explaining to them the objects of Mr. Hildebrand's coming.
He was also to collect information as to the state of affairs
and the position of the various factions in Hsenwi. He
was given authority, however, to insist on the cessation of
fighting, and empowered, if the necessity should arise, to
use force in maintaining peace. He was empowered also
to take action in Tawngpeng for securing the submission
of the Sawbwa, and to require him to pay tribute for the
past year of such sum as he (Mr. Daly) might judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
reasonable, explaining that this payment was exacted
because the Sawbwa had harboured disaffected persons.</p>

<p>The Northern Column left Hsipaw on the 29th of
December, 1887, and crossed into Tawngpeng territory.
All the villages were deserted, and on the 30th of December
the advance- and rear-guards were simultaneously fired
into. Two mules were killed and a driver wounded. A
few volleys into the bush dispersed the attacking party.
The town of Namhsam was reached on the 31st. All the
inhabitants had disappeared. Mr. Daly remained eight
days, in the hope of inducing the Sawbwa to come in, but
without success. He was able, however, to restore confidence.
The townspeople returned to their houses, and on
the march of the column to Hsenwi the villagers on the
road watched the troops without concern. The attack on
the column was afterwards explained. There was an old
standing feud between Tawngpeng and Hsipaw, dating
from a treacherous massacre of Tawngpeng officials by the
grandfather of Hkun Saing, the Sawbwa of Hsipaw. Mr.
Daly had been several weeks in Hsipaw, and a number
of Hsipaw bullock-drivers were with the column. This
aroused the suspicions of the Tawngpeng officials, and
orders were given to oppose any armed men from Hsipaw.
However this may have been, the misunderstanding was
only for a time.</p>

<p>Mr. Daly then went on to the town of Hsenwi, or rather
to the site of the town, for the town had been destroyed,
to meet San Ton Hon, who after some hesitation came
in to see him and arranged to attend the Conference at
Möngyai. The Northern Column then marched east to
the Kunlon Ferry on the Salween, to Mansi, where
San Ton Hon joined Mr. Daly and accompanied him to
Möngyai. Except that the submission of the Tawngpeng
Sawbwa had not been obtained owing to his timidity or
hostility, the task appointed to the Northern Column had
been executed with complete success.</p>

<p>But to go back. After the Durbar was over at Möngyai,
the Southern Column, according to its wont, gave a display
for the popular delight. On the first day there was a
sham-fight, which was viewed with much interest by chiefs
and followers; and on the second, garrison sports, which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
is related "proved a great attraction and tended in no
small degree to bring the troops and the people together
and to produce good feeling on both sides."</p>

<p>All hope of meeting any of the great Trans-Salween
chiefs was now past. Various causes had prevented them
from coming in, amongst others a raid made across their
track to Möngnai by the irrepressible Twet Nga Lu, and
some mischievous lies spread by Saw Ôn of Yawnghwè
regarding the withdrawal of the British forces. Trans-Salween
affairs had therefore to be laid aside for a more convenient
season. But much useful information was gathered
and recorded by the Superintendent and Mr. Scott.</p>

<p>From Lashio the column moved to Panglon, a village
on the eastern borders of Tawngpeng territory, to which
place the chief had been summoned to meet the Superintendent
and make his submission. He did not obey the
summons, but sent excuses for his absence alleging age and
infirmities, and saying that he wished his son to be accepted
as Sawbwa in his room. Two days afterwards this son,
entitled the Naw Möng, accompanied by most of the chief
officials, came in, and with humble apologies for the attack
made on the Northern Column, tendered his allegiance to
the British Government. As it appeared that the old
Sawbwa was nearly eighty years of age, it was decided to
accept the Naw Möng, Hkun Kyan, as chief, and to draw
out the <i>sanad</i>, or patent, in his name. This was done, and
the amount of revenue to be paid by Tawngpeng was
determined. It may be recorded here that Hkun Kyan
administered the State for seven years until 1895, when
he resigned on account of ill-health. A cousin succeeded
him but proved incompetent, and in 1904 a Government
officer was put in charge of Tawngpeng. At present, the
Sawbwa is administering the State satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Having settled this matter, the column marched into
Hsipaw. It is worth noting that Hkun Saing, the chief
of Hsipaw, had obtained greater favour from the British
Government than any other of the Shan chiefs. The more
prominent of them bitterly resented the concessions made
to Hkun Saing, namely: the remission of his revenue for
ten years and the conferment on him of the three States
of Möngtung, Mönglong, and Hsumhsai, to which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
no right. His services to the British Government consisted
in this, that he came down to meet the Chief Commissioner
at Mandalay and was the first to make his
submission to the Queen-Empress. It might have been
expected, therefore, that he would have made some show
of providing shelter and supplies for the troops. He did
nothing. The extraordinary favours which he had received
led him to think that he must be necessary to the Government,
and he made no effort to prove his gratitude. The
gift of Möngtung to Hkun Saing was resented by the
inhabitants of that State, who claimed independence and
wished to be ruled by their hereditary chief, who had been
dismissed by the Sawbwa of Hsipaw. Similar were the
feelings of the people of Mönglong, whose hereditary ruler,
Nga Maung, gave great trouble to our administration. Mr.
Hildebrand worked hard to arrive at some settlement by
which peace might be assured. He was unsuccessful, and
Möngtung as well as Mönglong was torn by dissension for
some years. At length in 1893, owing to this and other
administrative failures, a British officer was appointed to
advise and guide the Sawbwa Hkun Saing, and by this
means peace and order were restored.</p>

<p>On the 9th of April, after a tour of four months and
nineteen days, the Southern Shan Column, under Colonel
Swetenham, accompanied by Mr. Hildebrand and Mr. Scott,
marched into Mandalay. The expedition had done its
work well. Every chief, big and little, in the Cis-Salween
States had been met and his formal recognition of British
supremacy obtained. Long-existing feuds had been set at
rest, and claims the subject of prolonged fighting peaceably
adjudicated. The revenue payable by each State had been
ascertained, and with one or two exceptions definitely fixed.
The Southern Column had marched upwards of seven
hundred miles, and had passed through the territory of
every important chief. The few minor States untraversed
by it had been visited either by Captain Jackson, R.E., of
the Government of India Survey, or by Lieutenant Stanton,
D.S.O., of the Intelligence Department, accompanied in
each case by small parties of troops; and by their labours
a map had been constructed on which the position of every
important place in the Cis-Salween States was scientifically
fixed. Moreover, a mass of information regarding
the Shan country, its main features and products, and
the character and politics of the people, was collected,
invaluable to those engaged in administering this wide
country.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>
<p>If the Shans generally on the west of the Salween have
accepted British rule and learned to trust our good faith
and moderation, the credit must be given to the work
done by the two columns. Although that work was in
the main of a civil character, and the military force was
there as an escort and a protection in case of need, yet
the soldiers deserve quite as great a share of the blessing
promised to the peacemaker as the civilians. In building
the Indian Empire, soldiers and civilians have always
worked hand in hand. In Burma and the Shan States
the old tradition was not belied.</p>

<p>The civil officers with the columns recorded their gratitude
to Colonel Swetenham and his officers for their
unwearying efforts to assist the Superintendent in his
communications with the chiefs and the people. But
more than that: "It remains to be noted," writes Mr.
Scott, "that this desire to aid the Superintendent in his
duties was no less conspicuous among the native officers,
and the men, alike of the 2nd Queen's, the Battery, and
the 27th Punjab Infantry. The native officers in particular
took a most intelligent and evidently real interest in the
objects of the expedition. They not only succeeded in
suppressing all crime and ill-treatment of the people by
the sepoys and followers, but they were foremost in showing
the example of friendly and social intercourse with the
people. Nearly every one in the regiment had picked up
during their two years' stay in Burma a certain amount of
Burmese; to this was added a few words of Shan; and
these used freely on all occasions, whether apposite or not,
never failed to break down the nervousness and awe with
which the population was at first disposed to regard us.
Whenever we halted for any time, friendships were struck
up between the troops and the people, and that the goodwill
and esteem thus created was not merely superficial or
assumed was more than once proved in the most satisfactory
manner. Followers were lost or strayed away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the camp. In every case these animals or men were taken
care of, fed, and in some cases clothed and physicked and
eventually sent on to join the column." A further proof
of the friendliness of the people was the immunity of the
mails from detention or pillage. Although sent without
guards by native runners, they were invariably delivered
after passing sometimes through many States and many
hands. "If, therefore," concludes Mr. Scott, "as there
can be no doubt is the case, the Cis-Salween States have
definitely and thankfully accepted our suzerainty, no small
share of the credit of our success is due to the exertions
of the officers of the Shan Column."</p>

<p>In dealing with semi-savage and ignorant races, the
power of rumour and misrepresentation can hardly be
overestimated. When the Shans saw that the Southern
Column left no detachment behind it at Möngnai, and
instead of returning from Hsenwi to Fort Stedman marched
down to Mandalay, rumour began to be busy and the
ignorant imagination of the people to seek reasons for this
movement. Ready at hand to supply food for fancy was
Saw Ôn, the Yawnghwè Sawbwa. An intriguer and gossip
by nature, he sat down to write letters to all the greater
chiefs, informing them that the garrison at Fort Stedman
had been reduced to forty men. This advanced person
had already begun to take in some of the Rangoon papers
and to read the telegrams, which he could not understand
but from which he contrived to extract the notion that
there was going to be a European war and that the British
were withdrawing their troops from Burma, to which the
notices in the papers of troops leaving in the course of
the ordinary reliefs seemed to point. These letters reached
men even more ignorant than himself. The impression
gained ground that the British power was passing, and
the disappointed claimants, the adventurers, and the men
with a grievance saw an opportunity for action.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the chief of Eastern Karenni
had not met Mr. Hildebrand at Möngnai. The country
of the Karenni, or Red Karens, has an area of nearly five
thousand square miles, much of which is hill and forest.
On the east it is bounded by Siamese territory; on the
north by the Shan States; on the south by Lower Burma;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and on the west by a hill tract which separates it from
the level country of Burma proper. It is divided into
Eastern Karenni and Western Karenni. We are concerned
at present with the former, which consists of one single
State, Gantarawadi. The ruler of this State was Sawlapaw.
He resided at the chief place, Saw Lon, and he is
aptly described by Mr. Scott as a stubborn man from his
youth, who had grown old in the belief that his country
was impregnable and his people in their hills invincible.
He was confirmed in this unfounded belief by the extraordinary
timidity and cowardice of the Shans, who
habitually submitted to be raided and robbed, and to see
their people carried away into slavery by this overbearing
savage and his men.</p>

<p>Now Sawlapaw had a long-standing grievance with the
adjoining Shan State of Mawkmai. The cause, or the alleged
cause, was the seizure by the Sawbwa of Mawkmai, twenty-two
years before, of a number of elephants and timber in
Karenni forests. He had endeavoured to get redress from
the Burmese Government twice, but without success. The
Burmese Government had disappeared, and now he had
seen a British force come and go, he was told for good
and all. He thought his opportunity had come, and
advanced on Mawkmai. The Sawbwa of that State, by
name Hkun Hmon, had a bad conscience. His father, Ne
Nwe, the man whom Sawlapaw accused of robbing him
of his elephants, had died some time back. According to
Shan custom Hkun Hmon ought to have buried his father
and divided the personality amongst certain relations who
were entitled to it. Shan custom demanded that the burial
should precede the payment of the legacies. Hkun Hmon
disliking the idea of parting with the property, put off the
burial indefinitely, making, it may be hoped, some sort of
decent, if temporary, shelter for his father's body, by
placing it, for example, in a coffin of teak with a generous
covering of honey.</p>

<p>Now the principal legatees were in Möngnai, and were
connections of the Möngnai Sawbwa. Hence the "Smock-faced"
Hkun Hmon, as Mr. Scott dubs him, when he heard
of the Karenni force advancing upon him, knowing that
Möngnai and the Karenni chief were allies, became conscience-stricken;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and, imagining that a combined attack
would be made on him, fled without raising a finger to
defend himself. The Karenni entered Mawkmai on the
2nd of March without let or hindrance. They proceeded to
burn the town and ravage the country. They destroyed
everything. Even the monasteries and bridges were burnt.
The Mawkmai Valley, which up to that time had escaped
devastation and was the only part of the Shan States that
had been spared, was completely ruined. Sawlapaw then
appointed a man of his own to be Sawbwa of Mawkmai,
and declared the State to be annexed to Karenni. Hitherto
Eastern Karenni had been treated with much forbearance
by the Chief Commissioner&mdash;more, perhaps, because it was
inconvenient to move against it just then than from a
desire to spare Sawlapaw.</p>

<p>Mr. Scott, after returning to Mandalay with the Southern
Shan Column (see p. 180), had hurried back by the Natteik
Pass to Fort Stedman. Late in April the Chief Commissioner
sent him orders to clear the Karenni out of Mawkmai
and restore the rightful Sawbwa, Hkun Hmon. He left
Fort Stedman on the 2nd of May, with a party under
Colonel Sartorius of the Beleuchi Regiment, to execute these
orders.</p>

<p>The same influences which had led Sawlapaw to go
on the warpath, at this moment had operated on the
energetic mind of Twet Nga Lu. Since his expulsion from
Kengtawng by the Möngnai troops (vide p. 168) he had
remained on the east of the Salween, and had collected
a number of his ruffianly followers who had been able
to get arms and powder from Chiengmai. Crossing the
river he took the town of Möngpan on the 4th of March,
the day after the Karenni's seizure of Mawkmai.</p>

<p>The news of these disturbances had reached Mr. Hildebrand
at Hsipaw. He had sent orders to the Möngnai
Sawbwa to collect men to expel Twet Nga Lu and to
reinstate Hkun Hmon in Mawkmai. Hkun Kyi raised what
men he could and attacked Twet Nga Lu's position, but
he was defeated, followed up by the bandit, and had to seek
safety in flight. This happened on the evening of the
3rd of May.</p>

<p>On the 6th of May fugitives from Möngnai brought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
news of this catastrophe to Mr. Scott, who was <i>en route</i>
to Mawkmai with Colonel Sartorius. There was no
hesitation. The direction of the march was at once changed
to Möngnai. Mr. Scott saw at once the lucky chance
offered to him of making an end of Twet Nga Lu. On the
9th of May a halt was made at Kanglu, nine miles west
of Möngnai. The morning of the 10th of May was very
wet, which rendered a surprise of the enemy more possible.
Mr. Scott had studied the ground when he was with the
Southern Column, and felt able to guide a mounted party in
the hope of capturing the noted filibuster. There was no
Mounted Infantry with the column. All the officers' ponies
were requisitioned. Six men of the Rifle Brigade and one
man of the Beleuchi Regiment were thus mounted; and
under the command of Lieutenant Fowler of the Beleuchis,
and led by Mr. Scott, the little party started on the adventure.</p>

<p>Following bypaths over the hills, they escaped notice,
and the heavy rain falling kept most of the peasants under
shelter. The town was entered by the south. Mr. Scott,
knowing the ground, led them straight to the Sawbwa's
haw&mdash;palace is too grand a name&mdash;a teak and bamboo
structure with a stockade round it. Evidently the brigand
felt quite secure. Hardly any one was about, and Twet Nga
Lu himself was in bed in the verandah. He was seized and
secured before he quite knew what had happened. This could
not be done, however, without some noise, which brought in
an armed crowd of his chief retainers. Mr. Scott ordered
them peremptorily to sit down, which is the Burmese
equivalent of "Hands up!" They hesitated. A straight
blow between the eyes dropped the foremost. The rest
sat down at once, and before they had time to count their
opponents or take stock of the situation, the riflemen had
collected their arms. An anxious and rather bad time
followed until firing was heard, and the gallant little advance
party knew that their supports had come into action.
Colonel Sartorius entered the town from the north, and
after a slight engagement, in which four of the ruffians were
killed, the town was cleared of the armed rabble which had
held it.</p>

<p>Along with Twet Nga Lu were taken six notable captains,
the chief of whom was Hkun Sang Möng Cheng, his most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
trusted bravo, for years a terror to the hillside for his
cruelty. He and Twet Nga Lu were famous for their
powers of tattooing and charming, and all of them were
universally believed to be proof against bullet or steel.
Mr. Scott decided to let the Möngnai Sawbwa try them,
all except Twet Nga Lu, according to Shan custom. The
Sawbwa sentenced them to death, and after the Superintendent
had considered and confirmed the sentence, they were
shot on a crowded market-day in Möngnai, by a firing-party
of Beleuchi Rifles. The executions were carried out
in the presence of British officers and with every regard to
humanity and decency. No greater scoundrels have ever
met with a more deserved punishment. "All these malefactors,"
records the Superintendent, "were charmed against
bullet and sword wound, and news of their death spread
like wildfire throughout the States, and has done much
to reform previously incorrigible murderers."</p>

<p>Twet Nga Lu himself was sent into Fort Stedman, presumably
as being too noted a personage to be dealt with by
a Sawbwa. The Shan States, on the annexation of Upper
Burma, had been swept into the net and were constituted a
part of British India before accurate information had been
gained of their political conditions and their relations to the
King's Government. On this account there were technical
difficulties in the way of a trial by the Superintendent.
The Chief Commissioner's orders to the Assistant Superintendent
were in these words: "As to the prisoners,
including Twet Nga Lu, send such as are Siamese subjects
or natives of doubtful States in custody to Fort Stedman;
make over natives of British Shan States to Möngnai
Sawbwa for trial and punishment according to Shan custom&mdash;but
do not allow any cruel or barbarous punishments.
Take care that Twet Nga Lu does not effect his escape.
If the Möngnai Sawbwa sentences any prisoner to death
for an offence other than murder, suspend execution until
you get orders on this point." Mr. Hildebrand was instructed
therefore to send Twet Nga Lu back to Möngnai
to be tried by the Sawbwa. On the way he attempted to
escape, and was shot by the Beleuchi guard escorting him.
The men returned to Fort Stedman and reported what had
happened, saying that they had buried him on the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>It was desired to verify this statement, as there might
have been trouble if the brigand had escaped, or even if the
Shans had not believed him to have been killed. Unfortunately
Mr. Scott, who was at Möngnai, was too unwell to
go to the place, and did not visit it for some time. When
he was able to go he found the marks of a very shallow hole,
but no human remains of any kind except a long lock of
hair, which might have been Twet Nga Lu's. The Shans,
however, all believed that Twet Nga Lu was dead, and there
was no reason to discredit the report of the Beleuchi sepoys.</p>

<p>All doubt on this point was removed afterwards. The
scene of the brigand's death was in the wooded hills which
border Möngpawn. The day after he was shot a party
of Shans from Möngpawn disinterred, or rather lifted, the
corpse from its shallow grave, and shook off the loose earth.
The head was cut off, shaved, and sent to Möngnai, and
exhibited there at the north, south, east, and west gates
of the town during the absence of the Assistant Superintendent
at Fort Stedman. The various talismans were
removed from the trunk and limbs. Such charms are
generally small coins or pieces of metal, which are inserted
under the skin. These would be doubly prized as having
been enshrined in the flesh of so noted a leader, and
no doubt were eagerly bought up. The body was then
boiled down, and a concoction known to the Shans as Mahè
Si was obtained, which is an unfailing charm against all
kinds of wounds. So valuable a "medicine" did not long
remain in the hands of the poor, and soon found its way
into some princely medicine-chest. The value attached
to the fat of the tiger, and the demand for it by men of
greater culture than the Shans could or can boast, are
known to all Indian sportsmen. Such was the end of
Twet Nga Lu. It was certainly, so far as the body is
concerned, most complete.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

THE KARENNIS, OR RED KARENS, AND SAWLAPAW</h2>


<p>It has been told how Mr. Scott was on his way to
Mawkmai, when Twet Nga Lu's enterprise caused
him to turn his course to Möngnai. He now returned
to the original object of his expedition, namely, the expulsion
of the Karennis from Mawkmai and the restoration
of the Sawbwa Hkun Hmon, whom they had expelled.
He reached Mawkmai with the force under Colonel Sartorius
on the 16th of May, 1888, and found that the Karennis had
not awaited his coming. Mawkmai was occupied, and
Sawbwa Hkun Hmon reinstated. Colonel Sartorius returned
to Fort Stedman with the main portion of his
command, leaving, in accordance with the instructions
given to him, a hundred and fifty rifles, under Lieutenant
Fowler, at Mawkmai, which was considered to be the most
fitting post for the civil officer and his escort.</p>

<p>Mawkmai being only a long march of twenty-five miles
from Möngnai, a detachment of twenty-five rifles was
thought enough to support the Sawbwa, and in June,
Hkun Hmon reported that the Karennis had quitted
his country. All seemed to have settled down. The
Superintendent did not hesitate, therefore, to call Mr.
Scott to Fort Stedman for various business matters.
Mr. Scott reached Fort Stedman on the 28th of June, and
reported that all was well. Lieutenant Fowler was at
that time in Mawkmai. On the 1st of July he moved his
headquarters to Möngnai, leaving the detachment of
twenty-five rifles to garrison Mawkmai. The Karennis,
it may be presumed, were watching his movements, for
on the 3rd of July, in the evening, a body of Karennis
attempted to rush the town. They were repulsed, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
kept up a fire on the defenders until long after dark. The
twenty-five Beleuchis, seconded by the Sawbwa and his
armed rabble, returned the fire and inflicted some loss
on the enemy, who had withdrawn to a short distance.
Considering it unsafe, after this experience, to leave Mawkmai
with so small a detachment, Lieutenant Fowler moved
his headquarters back to that place.</p>

<p>The monsoon was now in full force. With roads of the
most primitive kind and swollen rivers, rapid travelling
was difficult. Mr. Scott left Fort Stedman as soon as the
news of what had happened reached him. Leaving his
baggage to make what speed it could, he rode on and arrived
at Mawkmai half-starved and dressed in some Shan
garments which he had borrowed on the way to replace
his dripping clothes, only to find that the fighting was
over. Lieutenant Fowler, learning that the enemy
had taken up a position within a day's march of Mawkmai,
went straight for them, carried their entrenchments at
the point of the bayonet, and drove them out with a loss
to them of sixty men. This experience ought to have
diminished the arrogance of Sawlapaw. He was very
little moved by it. He wrote on the 13th of July in the
most royal style, requesting the withdrawal of British
troops from Mawkmai lest they should be "accidentally
harmed" by his men when he attacked Hkun Hmon.
This letter was returned to Sawlapaw's messengers by the
Chief Commissioner's orders. A letter written in August,
in which he explained his claims against Mawkmai, and
asserted that he did not know the relations of that State
to the British Government, was dealt with in the same way.
Both these letters were written in a style that was inconsistent
with the position of the Karenni chief, and they
meant defiance.</p>

<p>In July, 1888, the matter was referred to the Government
of India, and their sanction was received in August to
demand from Sawlapaw compensation for the damage done
to Mawkmai and securities for his future good behaviour,
and to enforce these demands if they were not complied
with.</p>

<p>In September, as the Karenni chief showed no signs
of yielding, or willingness to meet Mr. Hildebrand, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Chief Commissioner prepared and placed in the Superintendent's
hands an ultimatum in the following terms:
Sawlapaw was required firstly to come in to Fort Stedman,
and there make in person his submission as a chief
subordinate to the Queen-Empress. Secondly, to pay
an indemnity of two lakhs of rupees to cover the damage
done to Mawkmai and the cost of the expedition sent
to relieve that State; thirdly, to surrender five hundred
serviceable muskets; lastly, to covenant to pay annually
a tribute of five thousand rupees to the British Government.
This ultimatum was placed in the Superintendent's (Mr.
Hildebrand's) hands, but he was instructed to withhold
it until November, and meanwhile to endeavour by all
possible means to persuade Sawlapaw to come to terms.</p>

<p>In October it seemed as if the Karenni chief was
beginning to have some misgivings. He adopted a tone
of humility and apology, which led Mr. Hildebrand to
hope for a peaceful ending. To make it easier for him, a
reduction of the indemnity and of the number of the guns
to be surrendered was allowed to Sawlapaw if he made his
personal submission without delay. Later on, at Mr. Hildebrand's
request, the Chief Commissioner allowed Mawkmai
to be substituted for Fort Stedman as the place to which
the chief should come, so that he should have a very short
distance to travel beyond his own borders. On November
16th, as the obstinate chief showed no signs of yielding,
the ultimatum was despatched. On the 17th a letter was
received by the Superintendent bearing the date of November
5th. This letter, which had been written in a much
more friendly tone, had been delayed <i>en route</i>. In it
Sawlapaw proposed that Mr. Hildebrand should meet
him at Loikaw on December 14th, accompanied "by a
small escort," so that the people "should not be alarmed."
"The reason," he added, "why I propose Loikaw is that
at present I am like a mother with her child in her arms;
she has to be with it always in order to prevent it crying;
my people will feel my absence if I go to Fort
Stedman." Mr. Hildebrand was permitted to accede to
this request, provided Sawlapaw brought with him the
two lakhs of rupees and the five hundred muskets required
by the ultimatum. As an alternative the chief was told
that if before the 14th of December he sent in the money
and arms to Fort Stedman, to prove his good faith,
the date for his personal submission at Loikaw would be
postponed to the 1st of January, 1889. These concessions,
which were made in the hope of avoiding a conflict, led
to nothing except, perhaps, the hardening of Sawlapaw's
heart. To leave the shelter of his own territory, and present
himself before a foreign potentate whom he is conscious
of having offended, was a hard thing to ask of a half-civilized
ruler. But there was no evidence that Sawlapaw had any
honest intention of submitting. He was said on all sides
to be preparing to resist us. It is just possible that if
the Superintendent had been allowed further latitude he
might have persuaded the Karenni to make some sort of
apology. To the Chief Commissioner it appeared absolutely
necessary, as an example, to insist on open and unmistakable
personal submission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>
<p>During all these negotiations, preparations for the expedition
had been going on. It was expected that the main
strength of Sawlapaw's resistance would be on his northern
boundary. He would in all likelihood raid the districts of
Lower Burma on his south; or, if he were hard pressed,
he might try to escape in that direction, or he might cross
into his own territory on the east of the Salween. It was
settled, therefore, that there should be two columns. The
main force, which was to make the real attack and to
occupy Sawlôn, the capital of Eastern Karenni, was to
concentrate at Saga, thirty-six miles south of Fort Stedman,
on the 27th of December. The other was to travel up by
the Salween <i>viâ</i> Papun, and march on Bawlaké in Western
Karenni. Its duty was to cover the districts of Lower
Burma, and at the same time to distract the attention of
the enemy and also prevent his retreat southward. The
command of this force was given to Colonel Harvey. To
meet any attempt on Sawlapaw's part to escape eastward,
a suggestion made by the British representative at Bangkok
that the Siamese might be asked to co-operate had been
accepted in August, and no further measure in this direction
was thought necessary.</p>

<p>With Colonel Harvey were one hundred rifles of the
Cheshire Regiment and one hundred and fifty rifles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the 8th Madras Infantry. Fifty rifles of the latter regiment
had been advanced to Papun early in November,
and the frontier posts of that district, which were held
by Gurkha and Karen (Lower Burma) police, were reinforced.
At the same time, in order to bring pressure to
bear upon Sawlapaw and the Karennis, who depend to a
large extent on imported food, a blockade was established
and all exports from British territories stopped.</p>

<p>On the 7th of December Mr. Hildebrand reported that
the Mawkmai Sawbwa had received letters from Sawlapaw
announcing his intention to fight. On the 10th of December
he telegraphed from Mobye that there was no hope
of a peaceful solution. Lest an advance from the south
should endanger a settlement, Colonel Harvey had been
held back by the Chief Commissioner's orders. On the
receipt of Mr. Hildebrand's telegram from Mobye, he was
ordered to cover the frontier of the Salween district, arranging
to reach Bawlaké on the date on which the Northern Column
hoped to occupy Sawlôn. Colonel Harvey arrived at Papun
on the 19th of December. Two days previously Kyaukhnyat,
a village on the Salween River north-east of Papun, was
attacked by a considerable number of Karennis. The
village was burnt and the bazaar plundered under the
eyes of the police, who were content to defend their own
post. The delay, intended to avoid bloodshed, resulted,
as often happens, in encouraging the enemy to strike the
first blow. Another post was also attacked about the same
time. As a precaution Colonel Harvey was strengthened
by the addition of fifty British and one hundred Madras
Rifles, and moved from Papun to Bawlaké on the 26th of
December. Pazaung, a stockade held by Karennis, was
taken without difficulty, and as that place offered a favourable
position for covering the frontier of Lower Burma,
Colonel Harvey remained there until he heard of the
occupation of Sawlôn. The bulk of his column then
returned to their quarters, leaving some Madras Rifles to
strengthen the police outposts for a time.</p>

<p>The Northern Column was commanded by Brigadier-General
H. Collett, C.B. It was composed of the following
troops:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
2 guns, No. 1 Mountain Battery, Bengal.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>100 rifles, 1st Battalion Rifle Brigade.<br />
250 rifles, 1st Beluchi Light Infantry.<br />
4 signallers and 40 Mounted Infantry, Rifle Brigade.<br />
70 Mounted Infantry, 1st Beluchi Light Infantry.<br />
25 Queen's Own, sappers and miners, with medical and commissariat staff.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the 19th of December final orders were communicated
to Mr. Hildebrand by wire. They prescribed the course
to be followed in each of the possible cases that might
arise, while at the same time allowing him a wide discretion
in arranging the details. The main points on which
the Chief Commissioner insisted were that the East Karenni
chief should make his submission in an unmistakable
fashion, and give substantial guarantees for his future
good conduct. Accordingly, whether Sawlapaw met Mr.
Hildebrand at Loikaw or not, the Superintendent, with
the column, was to proceed to Sawlôn, and there arrange
the conditions on which he was to retain his position as
a feudatory chief, of which open personal submission was
the most essential.</p>

<p>The instructions then proceeded as follows: "If your
march is opposed by armed force, the nature of the
measures to be taken will be a military question, to
be decided by the officer commanding; except on purely
military grounds of urgent necessity, the Chief Commissioner
does not wish villages to be burnt; in no case
must villages be sacked. Your object should be to show
the people that our quarrel is not with them, but with
Sawlapaw. Loikaw should not be destroyed, unless the
officer commanding thinks it necessary on military grounds.
You should remain at Sawlôn till the future administration
is settled. If you are forced to turn out Sawlapaw, it will
be necessary for you to stay there till you receive the Chief
Commissioner's orders on your recommendations; this may
involve delay, but it cannot be avoided. It is desirable to
humble Sawlapaw, and ensure his peaceful behaviour in
future; but very undesirable to cause him to fly and leave
the country in confusion. The object is to keep him in
a friendly, subordinate alliance. You have liberty, if he
submits, to mitigate the terms to such extent as you may
think necessary to secure his future friendship, and to let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
him see that we have no desire to harm him. If he does
not submit, it will be necessary to punish him."</p>

<p>The terms and tenor of these orders will suffice to show
that although the Chief Commissioner had little expectation
of the peaceful settlement still hoped for by Mr. Hildebrand,
he was anxious to avoid a conflict. It appeared to him
that further delays and concessions could only result in
encouraging Karenni arrogance, and would be misunderstood
by others. There were military reasons, moreover,
for finishing the business quickly and letting the troops
return from the field.</p>

<p>General Collett, having assembled his force at Saga, left
that place on the 29th for Sawlôn, Sawlapaw's capital. His
route lay by Loikaw. As far as Nga Kaing, a village one
march from that place, a good road had been cleared and
bridged by the Sawbwa of Yawnghwè, the Myoza of Saga,
and in that portion of it which passed through Sawlapaw's
territory by Karennis acting under the instructions of the
Mobye Sawbwa. On the part of the peasantry there was
no enmity towards us.</p>

<p>The road for some way before reaching Nga Kaing passed
through scrub jungle, which gave an enemy every chance
of annoying the troops. Nothing, however, occurred, and
on the 1st of January, 1889, the force debouched into the
wide open paddy plain of Karenni without being molested.
While the camp was being pitched, the Beleuchi Scouts,
who were exploring some wooded ground near the village,
were fired upon. They were immediately joined by the
Beleuchi Mounted Infantry, under Lieutenant Tighe. The
enemy, driven through the wood and compelled to break
cover, attempted to make for the high ground; but, our
men getting between them and the hills, forced them into
the plain. They numbered two or three hundred, most
of them Shans under two of Sawlapaw's officials, and
were not without courage. Several times they turned
and stood to face their pursuers; but, ill-armed and without
discipline, they had not a chance. The threescore
of Mounted Infantry broke them up, rode them down, and
drove them almost up to Loikaw, eight miles distant, inflicting
heavy loss. Some of them, seeing escape to be
hopeless, turned fiercely on their enemies, and the Beleuchis
lost four killed and seven wounded in the pursuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>There was little chance for a combatant soldier to gain
distinction against such a foe. Captain Crimmin, of the
Indian Medical Service (Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel John
Crimmin, V.C., C.I.E.), was awarded a Victoria Cross for
gallantry in this action.</p>

<p>General Collett pressed on at once with a portion of his
force, in order to complete the rout. He reached Loikaw
after dark, and found it deserted.</p>

<p>Loikaw consisted of two parts, inhabited by two separate
communities, the one of Shans, the other of Karens. The
latter was quite deserted. But the Shans sent out a
mission with green leaves, the equivalent of a flag of
truce, to welcome our people, and did what they could
to make the bivouac on the ground north of the village
comfortable for them. Thus the night of New Year's Day
saw General Collett with Mr. Hildebrand and a part of the
force occupying Loikaw, while the remainder of the troops
and the baggage were in the rear at Nga Kaing. On the
next day, the 2nd of January, General Collett halted, to
allow the rest of the column and the baggage to come up.
The difficulty of moving even five hundred men in this
country, destitute as it was of supplies for British and
Indian soldiers, and equally destitute of roads, was great.
The transport bullocks numbered thirteen hundred; there
were ponies and elephants and camp followers innumerable.
The 3rd of January was taken up in getting the column
ferried across a stream named the Balu, which runs below
Loikaw, and is eighty yards wide and unfordable.</p>

<p>While the soldiers were thus occupied the Superintendent
used the delay to distribute a proclamation issued by the
Chief Commissioner, explaining why the force had entered
the Karenni country, and promising that the peaceful
inhabitants should suffer no harm. The result of this was
that some of the elders came in to ask for flags or other
tokens which they might use to show that their villages
were not hostile. The peasants generally had left their
homes, they said, and fled to the hills, and would not return
unless they had some assurance of safety. Mr. Hildebrand,
therefore, having found in the baggage some red cloth, made
flags and gave them to the elders for distribution. Before
the evening of the 3rd people were returning in numbers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
their homes, and applications for red flags came in from all
sides. When the force continued its march flags were
found placed on the paths leading up to villages from the
main track.</p>

<p>Sawlôn was found to be four marches from Loikaw. On
the 4th General Collett began to move, and encamped at
Kawpiti, where trees had been felled and thrown across the
road, and the advance-guard of Mounted Infantry was fired
on. Our men replied, and the enemy, having suffered some
loss, retreated. Some villagers came up with a red flag to
warn our men that the jungle on either side of the road
had been spiked, as Sawlapaw had taken measures to
oppose us. The warning was useful, and only one pony
was injured.</p>

<p>On the 5th the ferry on the Pon Chaung River, at a place
called Tilanga, was reached. There had been no opposition
hitherto, but directly the scouts appeared on the river bank
fire was opened on them from the other side, a distance of
one hundred and fifty yards. There was a village on the far
bank from which the shots came. Our men returned the
fire, but, as it seemed, with no effect. The guns were
brought up, and two shells were dropped into the village,
and set it on fire. All resistance then ended; but the river
had to be crossed. Empty rum casks had been brought
with the force, and the sappers began to make rafts. The
river, however, was deep and rapid, and the attempt to
cross the force on rafts had to be given up. The enemy
had removed and concealed their boats. A close search was
made for them, and six or seven were discovered. A ford
at some little distance was found practicable for elephants,
and amongst the Shans who followed the force sufficient
skilled boatmen were found to man the boats. On the
next day, the 6th of January, General Collett began to cross
his men, and by the evening the whole force was on the
other side of the Pon Chaung. The elephants and boatmen
were exhausted, and could do no more that day, while all
the commissariat bullocks and their loads still remained to
be brought across the stream.</p>

<p>On the 7th, leaving a guard for the bullocks and baggage
which had not crossed, the main force pushed on. The
road now became very difficult. It narrowed down to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
steep path, on the east side of which rose abruptly a range
of rocky hills, on the west side ran the Pon Chaung, with
its tangled jungle, affording the best of cover to an enemy.
The ascent was sometimes severe. Small parties of the
enemy were concealed on the slopes of the hills at short
distances, and occasional shots were fired from the opposite
bank of the river. An enemy with more knowledge or
better arms might have made the advance very difficult.
As it was, the hillsides on our left had to be searched and
cleared before the main body could pass. It was dusk
before Sakangyi, about six miles from the last bivouac,
was reached. The casualties were one man in the Rifle
Brigade killed and one wounded; two Beleuchis severely
wounded; and Surgeon Manders shot through the thigh.</p>

<p>During the night the baggage came slowly in. The last
bullock was not in camp until several hours after sunrise.
The enemy made no attempt to annoy the baggage or the
rear-guard. Leaving on the 8th, as soon as the men had
breakfasted and the rear-guard was in camp, the force
worked its way on in the same manner as on the day
before. Firing went on incessantly, but the flanking
parties of Beleuchis did their work perfectly. The woods
within range were thoroughly beaten and cleared of the
enemy, and the force passed through the defile (capturing
two guns, both mounted on carriages, on the hilltop)
and entered the more open country without a casualty.</p>

<p>Sawlôn was now in view. The Beleuchis, under Colonel
Sartorius (Colonel George Conrad, C.B.), were sent forward
at once to occupy the town, which stands on a plateau some
three hundred feet above the river. It was found to be
quite deserted. The rest of the column encamped on the
bank of the river below.</p>

<p>It may be well here to give some account of Sawlôn, the
capital of the Red Karen country, as it was in January,
1889. It stands on some high ground about a mile to the
east of the Pon Chaung. The hills at this point rise by
three steps, the first and second of which open out into
two small plateaux. The town is on the first step. To
those looking at it as the force left the defile, it appeared
to consist of a few huts. On ascending the hill, however,
it was found to be well laid out, and to contain some really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
fine houses. Three broad streets ran through the town
parallel to each other, and were crossed at right angles
by connecting roads of lesser width. There was an
excellent water-supply. A stream from the plateau above
the town had been led down the face of an almost
perpendicular rock, and formed a very picturesque waterfall.
On reaching the level it flowed through the town
from east to west. The channel which carried the main
supply was substantially bridged in each of the main
streets. On both sides of every street in the town were
smaller channels, fed from the parent stream. The watercourses
were all carefully lined with teak to prevent erosion.
Posts with glass lamps stood before the houses of the better
class. Here and there in the main street a perambulator
was seen standing, where it had been left when the people
fled. A box in Sawlapaw's storehouse was found full of
babies' bottles, together with a very large stock of arrowroot.
Evidently the younger generation of the Karennis
inclined towards the luxuries of the West.</p>

<p>The chief, however, was said to stand on the ancient
ways, rarely quitting his house, except to climb to his
paddy-fields above the town, which he worked with his
own hands like an ordinary peasant. His haw, or palace,
however, gave some signs of his rank&mdash;a large old rambling
house of teak, inside a teak palisade, with a smaller house
for his wife in the same enclosure; a stable close by, with
loose-boxes for four ponies, well built of teak, with iron-barred
windows, and raised about three feet above the
ground. Teak timber, which formed the wealth of the
State, was lying about everywhere. The road leading up
from the river to the town was littered with fine logs. It
seemed that there would be little difficulty in recovering the
indemnity demanded from Sawlapaw. Near the palace was
an immense timber-yard with four sheds; in each shed were
four saws. The yard was full of timber sawn and in the
rough. The converted timber was methodically stacked in
wooden frames round the yard, each frame containing the
same cubic measurement of timber, so that there was no
need to count the pieces. The palace was by no means
the finest house in the town; that of Sawlawi, the Kya
Maing, or heir-apparent, was especially good. A monastery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and a rest-house, of great solidity and excellent workmanship,
with very good carving, stood a little way off.</p>

<p>With the occupation of Sawlôn the active military
operations ended. The work of Mr. Hildebrand was only
now beginning, and it was difficult and perplexing.
Sawlapaw had disappeared, and if the people knew his
whereabouts, none would tell. Little was known of the
inner politics of the Karenni State. If the old chief chose
to hide himself and let the case go against him by default,
who was to be appointed in his room? It will be remembered
that in the instructions given to Mr. Hildebrand,
the possibility of having to supersede Sawlapaw was
contemplated, and Mr. Hildebrand was definitely told
that he was to remain in Sawlôn until the future
administration had been settled and the Chief Commissioner's
orders received. In a private letter the Chief
Commissioner wrote: "In the alternative of Sawlapaw
running away and leaving the country without a governor,
you must find some one to take his place. I do not want
Karenni left on my own hands. You have had so much
practice in king-making that I need say no more."</p>

<p>Mr. Hildebrand's difficulties were much increased by
the announcement of the General in command, that the
column must leave Sawlôn on the 23rd of January, to
return to Fort Stedman, as the rations were insufficient
for a longer stay. The task before him was no easy
one in any case. That he should be able to effect a
settlement of Karenni affairs in a fortnight was too
much to hope. There was a risk that the object of
the expedition might be frustrated, and that the work
would have to be done over again. General Collett consented
to send for a supply of rations to meet the column
at Mobye, to enable him to remain at Sawlôn until the
30th of January. It is not known on whom the responsibility
rested for arrangements which might easily have
made the expedition fruitless.</p>

<p>There was no possibility of laying the matter before
the Chief Commissioner and obtaining his orders. Mr.
Hildebrand, therefore, took the risk on himself and set
to work at once to find Sawlapaw if possible; failing
that, to select some one in his room. As a first step a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
proclamation was issued calling upon Sawlapaw to appear
before the 18th of January, and stating that if he did not
come in a successor would be appointed to take charge
of his State pending the Chief Commissioner's orders. At
the same time the people generally were invited to come
to Sawlôn to confer with Mr. Hildebrand and advise
him on the choice of the man to be appointed, in case
Sawlapaw did not appear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it was as well to acquire some knowledge
of the feelings of the people. The Superintendent's camp
was moved up to the (Pongyi Kyaung) monastery, and
by constant intercourse with monks and people their
confidence was won, and an idea of the causes that had
led to Sawlapaw's flight was formed. The disaster suffered
by his men at Nga Kaing village on the 1st of January
had convinced Sawlapaw that further opposition to our
advance was hopeless. But there was a war party in the
State of which one Naw Maing of Loikaw was the head.
The measures taken to resist the force were the work
of this party. On the 5th of January the smoke of the
Tilanga village on the Pon Chaung was seen at Sawlôn.
The chief then made up his mind. He told those who
wished to remain to do as they pleased. For himself he
would leave Sawlôn and would never come back. He
took his wife and a few followers, and, forbidding any one
else to come after him, he went to the upper plateau above
the town, where he had another house, and was not
seen again in Sawlôn. No one would tell whither he
went.</p>

<p>Thereupon the Shan villagers (there was a Shan
community in Sawlôn) went to the Pongyi and moved
him to head a deputation to the officers with the British
force. On the morning of the 6th, with two red flags
and the customary green boughs, the party set out to
meet the British who were expected to arrive at Sawlôn
that day. When they did not arrive, thinking the delay
was on account of Sunday, the deputation returned to
the town. On the evening of the 6th General Collett's
force was encamped beside the Pon Chaung. A few
Beleuchi Mounted Infantry Scouts were sent on to
reconnoitre the road. At the entry of the defile they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
were fired on by some Karennis, and one of the ponies
was killed. They retreated without stopping to recover
the saddle. The Karennis, taking the saddle from the
dead pony, went back to Sawlôn in triumph, displaying
their spoil and declaring that the enemy were few in
number and had retreated. This put new spirit into
the war party, and the peace deputation dissolved. On the
7th, when it was reported that the British were advancing
in force, every one left the town, and it was found deserted,
as has been already told. In two or three days, however,
most of the people, Shans and Karens, had returned to
their homes.</p>

<p>There appeared to be little chance of inducing Sawlapaw
to make his appearance. The day fixed for Sawlapaw's
surrender was the 18th of January. On the 17th a
deputation representing the chief men of three of the
largest communities came to Mr. Hildebrand and begged
for further days of grace and a written safe-conduct for
Sawlapaw. Both requests were granted. Furthermore,
a promise was given that if he would come in and fulfil
the conditions of the ultimatum, he would be confirmed
in his position as head of the Karenni State. The date
for the appearance of Sawlapaw, or, failing this, the
election of his successor, was postponed until the 25th.</p>

<p>Mr. Hildebrand was assured that the Kya Maing, or
heir-apparent, who was a nephew of Sawlapaw, would
appear as a candidate for election. The 25th, the 26th,
and the 27th passed, but no Kya Maing. The long-suffering
patience of the Superintendent was exhausted.
Fate, in the form of commissariat supplies, demanded a
settlement before the 30th. Just as arrangements were
being made for an election, a note was brought in from
the Kya Maing to the effect that he was on his way to
Sawlôn from his hiding-place in the jungle, but had broken
down, footsore and weary. He promised to appear on the
next day. As the people earnestly besought that his
prayer might be granted, and as it was evident to the
Superintendent that this man, as heir to Sawlapaw and
acceptable to the people, was the right man to take charge
of the State, and as moreover one of the wealthiest men
in the State gave security to the amount of Rs. 20,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
that he would produce the Kya Maing, the proceedings
were postponed until the morrow.</p>

<p>The remaining time had now dwindled to twenty-four
hours, and the 28th of January was a day of anxiety for
Mr. Hildebrand. It was a relief when the arrival of the
Kya Maing was put beyond doubt. He made his
appearance at an early hour, a man (by name Sawlawi)
of about thirty-eight years of age, intelligent-looking, and
evidently popular in Karenni. The election was held at
noon. There were twenty-nine electors, of whom six
were Heins, or chiefs of divisions, four were the chiefs
or representatives of the Western Karenni States
subject to Sawlapaw, the rest were headmen of villages
or groups of villages, and traders in timber and other goods,
many of whom were men of wealth and influence. Each
man gave his vote, with the result that Sawlawi was
unanimously elected.</p>

<p>Fourteen of the wealthy electors entered into a joint bond
to pay the compensation of two lakhs and the five hundred
muskets specified in the ultimatum, and a further sum
of one lakh as war indemnity; the money to be paid
before the end of December into the Moulmein Treasury,
and the muskets to be lodged in Fort Stedman before the
end of the following March. The order of appointment
given by Mr. Hildebrand to Sawlawi was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I, the Superintendent of the Shan States, hereby
appoint you, Sawlawi, Kya Maing, to be Chief of the
State of Eastern Karenni, on the following conditions:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. That you shall govern your State in accordance with
established custom, and as a tributary to the British
Queen whom you acknowledge to be your Suzerain.</p>

<p>"2. That you shall enter into no negotiations, treaties,
or agreements with any other State than that of England.</p>

<p>"3. That you shall pay as tribute the sum of Rs. 5,000
yearly.</p>

<p>"4. That you will in all matters obey the orders of the
Superintendent of the Shan States.</p>

<p>"5. That in case of dispute with Siam about territory
east of the Salween, you will refer the matter to the
Superintendent of the Shan States for arbitration.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>
<p>"6. That no Shan, or Burman, or British subjects of
any race shall be detained in any part of Eastern Karenni
against their will, but that they shall have free liberty to
go where they please.</p>

<p>"Given under my hand and seal this 29th day of
January, 1889.</p>

<div class="right">

</div>

<p>The sixth clause was inserted to provide for the
abolition of slavery. It will be noted that the terms of
the order did not make the State of Eastern Karenni part
of British India. Experience of the difficulties arising
from the position of the Shan States as part of British
India, and of the absence of such difficulties in the case
of the feudatory States of the Central Provinces,
induced the Chief Commissioner to leave the Eastern
Karenni State in the position of a feudatory chiefship.</p>

<p>The fifth clause needs explanation. It has been told
above (p. 191) that a suggestion made by the British Representative
at Bangkok for inviting Siamese co-operation
had been acted upon. At the time no hint had been given
by the Siamese, so far as was known to the Administration
of Burma, that they had ulterior views, or claims to advance.
It was supposed, naïvely perhaps, that as a friendly
nation, anxious on many grounds to ensure the protection
of Great Britain, they had agreed to act partly to help the
British Government, partly to protect their own border. It
was not until the 10th of November, 1888, that Mr. Gould,
H.M.'s Representative at Bangkok, intimated that in return
for their co-operation the Siamese would probably wish to
establish their territorial rights over the Karenni possessions
lying east of the Salween. That was the first notice
of the Siamese intentions which reached the Chief Commissioner,
and he had dispatched his ultimatum to Sawlapaw
before its receipt. Mr. Gould was informed that the
ultimatum could not be altered to include the Siamese
claims. At the same time Mr. Hildebrand was instructed
to reserve those claims in his settlement with Sawlapaw.
Hence the insertion of the fifth clause in the order of
appointment given to Sawlawi.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the Siamese co-operation was purely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
nominal and valueless, too late to be of any use. On the
11th of December Bangkok was informed that the columns
from the Shan States and Papun would reach Sawlôn about
the 7th of January. On the 28th of December the Vice-Consul
at Chiengmai was told of the attack by the Karennis
on the police post at Kyaukhnyat, and was asked to move
the Siamese to act. On the 10th of January the result of
the fight near Loikaw was telegraphed to Bangkok and
Chiengmai. On the 17th they were informed of the
occupation of Sawlôn. While Mr. Hildebrand was arranging
matters after the occupation, a detachment of troops
went to reconnoitre Ywathit, a village on the right bank of
the Salween, about thirty miles south of Sawlôn. From
Ywathit a party went out to see the Salween, some three
miles away. This was on the 20th of January. On the
evening of that day the advance-guard of the Siamese force
appeared on the east bank of the Salween, at the mouth of
the Mèpai Chaung, and the officer commanding this party
was visited by the Assistant Commissioner, Mr. Barnard,
on the 21st of January. It was known from the Vice-Consul
at Chiengmai that the Siamese had taken no action
until the middle of January. This, however, is a digression.</p>

<p>On the day following the election, a Durbar was held in a
large hall in the rest-house in the grounds of the monastery,
near which the Superintendent had pitched his camp. The
place was well fitted for the occasion and was more ornate
than one would have expected to find in the wilds of
Karenni. A spacious chamber "built of the best sawn teak
with venetians and folding doors of good workmanship, and
a floor which might have been made for a ball-room, the
whole," writes the Superintendent, "both inside and out
being very highly finished with panelling and carving
and gilding." Here the notables, who had met for the
election of the new chief, and all the townspeople assembled,
and the Superintendent (as the Representative of the
British Government), supported by the General commanding
and all the officers of the force, opened the Durbar. A
broad, sturdy figure of a man, with a face that bore the
marks of work and climate, a determined man, patient and
considerate, but nevertheless a man accustomed to be
obeyed. There were no bright uniforms, no show of gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
or scarlet. Civil and military were all in the working-dress
of the field, soiled and stained with dust and sweat; for
the last few marches through the wooded defile of the Pon
Chaung had been very toilsome. Amongst the Shans and
Karens assembled, some spots of gay colour might be seen,
and smart white jackets here and there.</p>

<p>In a few words the causes which had led to the expedition
were explained and the consequences, namely, the
subordination of the Karenni chief to the British Government,
and the payment by him of an indemnity. This
might be unpleasant to some of them. On the other hand,
to the Karenni people at large, it meant a better government,
the cessation of raids and petty wars, the extension
and protection of trade, and undisturbed peace. The order
of appointment (provisional, as subject to the Chief Commissioner's
approval), was then read and given to Sawlawi.
Thus the Karenni territory, which had been hitherto independent
and had been protected by us from the designs of
Burma, became practically part of the Empire. It may be
noted that Mr. Hildebrand acted as the Representative of
the British Government on both occasions. On the first,
when he secured the independence of Karenni by negotiation
with the Burmese King; on the second, when he
made Karenni subordinate to the Government of India.</p>

<p>What was the first use made of his new power by Sawlawi?
His first thought was to rid his territory east of the
Salween of the Siamese troops now occupying it. The
Superintendent gave him letters to the Siamese commander,
announcing the fall of Sawlapaw and the appointment of
Kya Maing Sawlawi in his place; informing him that
matters had been arranged with the Karennis, that the
British force was withdrawing on the 30th of January, and
that Siamese co-operation was no longer necessary. At the
same time the Vice-Consul at Chiengmai was asked to use
his influence to procure the immediate recall of the Siamese
troops.</p>

<p>On the 30th of January the British troops left Karenni
and marched back to Fort Stedman. Sawlawi was left to
his own resources. Prophets of evil had foretold the immediate
reappearance of Sawlapaw and the vengeance to be
executed on his successor and his supporters. Excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
journalists published tales in Rangoon of wholesale executions
in Sawlôn under the old chief's orders. As a matter
of fact, the ex-Sawbwa never attempted to disturb the
Settlement, and the new Sawbwa, Sawlawi, carried out his
engagements punctually. The indemnity was paid and the
fire-arms surrendered. To the day of his death, in 1907, he
governed his people in an upright and capable manner.</p>

<p>It must be confessed there was some risk in leaving the
country the day after Sawlawi's instalment. The Chief
Commissioner's instructions were clear that the Superintendent
should remain in Sawlôn until he received orders
on his proposals. Mr. Hildebrand, however, had no choice,
and the risk had to be taken, because of the defective
arrangements for feeding the troops, which made it impossible
to stay. In taking the responsibility he did his
duty well. The only difficulty in Eastern Karenni arose
from the action of the Siamese Government in continuing
to occupy the territory east of the Salween, which had been
long held by the Karens, was vital to them, and had never
been in the possession of the Siamese.</p>

<p>This was a matter which threatened at any moment to
disturb the peace and gave anxiety to those responsible for
maintaining it. The first act of Sawlawi, as has been said,
after his appointment was to ask the assistance of the
Superintendent to procure the withdrawal of the Siamese
from the territory east of the Salween. The British Vice-Consul
at Chiengmai and the Siamese officer in command
of their troops were notified that peace had been made and
that the British troops were leaving the field; the withdrawal
of the Siamese was therefore necessary. The
Siamese claims had been reserved for settlement in the
terms of Sawlawi's appointment. The Chief Commissioner
prohibited the Karenni chief from attacking or making any
forcible resistance to them. When month after month
passed and they made no show of retiring, but on the
contrary began to appropriate the timber and even the
elephants of the Karenni traders, the local Government of
Burma was placed in a very uncomfortable position. Sawlawi
urged that he had accepted our terms, made his submission
and acknowledged himself to be the subordinate of
the Queen-Empress. He looked in return for the advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of British protection; apparently he was not to have it.
He knew well enough that it only needed a firm order and
a small display of force to cause the retirement of the
Siamese with more alacrity than they had displayed in their
advance. Why was nothing done? If he began to doubt
our good faith, it was no wonder.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact&mdash;a fact to him unknown, and unintelligible
if it had been known&mdash;the Chief Commissioner could
do nothing but put the case to the Government of India.
This was done in as strong words as possible. The
Government of India could do nothing except through the
Secretary of State; the Secretary of State could not act
except through the British Foreign Office; the Foreign
Office was obliged to work through the Siamese Embassy in
London and the British Resident in Bangkok; the King
of Siam had to consult his local lieutenants at Chiengmai.
The situation demanded patience, and much of it.</p>

<p>It has been said above that the territory occupied by the
Siamese was vital to the Karennis. Their best and most
extensive forests, the main source of their wealth, lay there.
The only way of getting timber to the market from the
forests was (and is) by floating it down the Salween, the
mouth of which is in British territory opposite to Moulmein.
The logs are stopped and collected at Kado, a short distance
from the mouth of the river, and a duty levied by the Government
of Burma. Every owner of timber has his stamp
with which he marks his logs, and a register of these stamps
is kept by the forest officer. The logs which had been
seized by the Siamese were easily distinguished, and orders
were given to the forest officer to detain them. By this
means a check was put upon the rapacity of the Siamese,
and the loss of the Karenni timber dealers restricted. In
the course of time, the matter was arranged between the
Siamese and the Foreign Office, and the Karennis were
restored to possession (<i>vide</i> Chapter XVIII, p. 221).</p>

<p>The history of this matter shows the difficulties which
the Government of India and their subordinates on the spot
meet with in dealing with a boundary dispute, even of a
simple kind, with a foreign country. The facts have to be
gathered locally and placed before the Government of India,
who then have to negotiate through the Foreign Office, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the risk of misunderstanding and the certainty of long
delays. It is unavoidable. Fortunately, on the north-western
frontier, where the delays and hesitation which
caused inconvenience in the disputes with Siam might breed
serious trouble, the action of the Government of India is
less trammelled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

THE TRANS-SALWEEN STATES</h2>


<p>With the capture of Twet Nga Lu and the subjugation
of the Red Karens all serious trouble in the Shan
States west of Salween ended. Writing in July, 1890,
the Superintendent of the Southern Shan States was able
to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"During the year under report, which extends from the
beginning of June, 1889, the Shan States have been perfectly
quiet. Nowhere have there been any revolts, nowhere
any insubordination or sedition; hardly anywhere, except
along the frontier with Burma, any dacoities or gang
robberies." (Report on the Shan States for 1889-90 by
Mr. (now Sir George) Scott.)</p>

<p>Pretenders had become convinced that they could not
succeed against the chiefs who had been confirmed in
possession by the Sovereign Power, and they settled down
to make the best of things. The floating army of ruffians
who had supplied the fighting material in past times had
disappeared, and contrived to pick up a living in more
peaceful ways.</p>

<p>"They make very good show-figures in a Sawbwa's processions,
with their tattooing from ankle to throat and their
chest and arms bossed all over with armlets and charms let
in below the skin. They are also admirable letter-carriers
to distant States. They know all roads, they are afraid
of nobody, and they seem to be able to trudge from dawn to
sunset for an indefinite number of days.... It is certain,
however, that the States are infinitely quieter than they
have been at any time since the death of King Mindon,
and probably quieter than they have been at all." (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>

<p>The year 1889 therefore offered a good opportunity for
attending to Trans-Salween affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in this year the question of the frontier line which
was to limit our responsibilities eastward was anxiously
considered. Some of the States west of the Salween which
had already come under our protection held or claimed
ground east of the river. There were others lying wholly
east of the Salween which had been subject to the dominion
of Burma although they had been loosely held. Of these
the most important, Kengtung and Kang Hung, held, or
claimed to hold, territory east of the Mekong.</p>

<p>It will be easily understood that the Government was
not eager to lay hold of more territory than it was bound
in honour to accept as the successor of the Burmese dynasty.
We had already taken as much as we could administer or
garrison with efficiency. Our authority was now definitely
established up to the Salween. The country lying between
that river and the Mekong was known to be mountainous,
unhealthy, and unprofitable, destitute of roads, a succession
of steep mountain ranges which made travelling most
laborious. To maintain even a handful of troops in that
region would be costly. Revenue, there would be none.
It was asked where were our responsibilities to end? It
was not easily answered. The problem had several sides&mdash;the
military, the political, and the administrative. From
the soldiers' point of view the arguments in favour of
making the Salween our eastern boundary had considerable
force. The river gave a clear and definite frontier
drawn from north to south. The advance of a possible
enemy through the country between the Mekong and the
Salween could not, from the nature of the ground, be made
without much difficulty; whereas the defence would have,
in the wide plateau with its rolling prairies on the west of
the Salween, an admirable position, with easy communications
open to the Irrawaddy Valley.</p>

<p>Looking at the matter, moreover, from a broader point of
view, it was doubtful whether the British dominion in India
was not outgrowing its strength. In 1886 the annexation
of Upper Burma added, roughly, 120,000 square miles to the
area for which the Government of India was responsible.
Of this, roughly speaking, 20,000 square miles lay across
the Salween. Before Upper Burma was added to the
Empire it had been argued by a great military authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
that if we were seriously threatened by an enemy beyond
the frontier of India, it would be necessary to recall the
garrison of British Burma and to let that province go
for the time. If there were any foundation for this opinion
the difficulty in the event supposed would be very much
increased by the addition of the new province. For no
addition had been made to the army in India since the
annexation. There were strong reasons, therefore, for not
going a yard farther than was necessary. The advance
beyond the Salween meant the inclusion of some 20,000
square miles of very difficult country and the possible
neighbourhood of a troublesome power.</p>

<p>In support of the military arguments it was urged that
the Salween was designed by nature for a boundary. It
cut its way, in a line running almost due north and south,
through steep mountains and rocks. It was not navigable
in its upper reaches; the mouth and the navigable portion
of the river were in our hands. But as a matter of fact,
however adapted by its natural formation for such a purpose,
the Salween has not been able to limit the spread of any race
or power that has settled on its banks. On the north the
Chinese hold both banks. The Shans have settled indiscriminately
on either side. It proved no obstacle to the
extension of the Burmese power to the eastward. In short,
so far from having been "an uncompromising natural
boundary," as it has been called, it has not been a
boundary at all except for a short length of about sixty
miles where it divides the Lower Burma Salween district
from Siamese territory. Moreover, it is a timber-floating
river. The teak cut on either bank must be rafted down
to Moulmein; and hence disputes would be sure to arise.
Rivers, as a rule, are held to be bad boundaries, and the
Salween is no exception.</p>

<p>At first sight the strategical objections to crossing the
Salween appeared to derive support from a consideration of
the relations to foreign powers which might follow. It was
not desired to take any step which might in the near future
bring us into contact with France, and thus add a new
factor to the frontier problems of our Indian Empire. The
Government was even more anxious to avoid action which
might give offence to Siam, or have the appearance of want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
of consideration in our dealings with that somewhat
unreasonable power.</p>

<p>Further examination, however, led to a doubt as to the
soundness of these views. Supposing that the British
Government, influenced by these motives, decided to decline
responsibility for these Trans-Salween States, what would
become of them? Even Kengtung, the most powerful, could
not stand alone. China and Siam might be invited to absorb
them, and thus a belt of territory might be placed between
our boundary and that of French dominion in Tonquin
China. But China, it was believed, had no wish to increase
her responsibilities in these regions, where her authority was
very weak. Siam might be willing enough, but her rule
would be feeble and unstable, and not welcome to the Shans.
Both countries on this frontier were more likely to lose
than to gain. If, with the view of avoiding the inconveniences
that might arise from becoming conterminous
with a great Western Power in these distant countries, we
should invite Siam or China, or both, to relieve us of the
charge of the Trans-Salween country, what security was
there that either of these powers would retain the territory
given to them? We might be creating the very conditions
we wished to avert. The result of a cautious policy of this
kind might be to make our dominion conterminous with
that of France, not on or beyond the Mekong but on the
Salween itself&mdash;an intolerable position.</p>

<p>Looking at the matter from an administrative and local
point of view, the Chief Commissioner was against stopping
short of the frontier claimed by the King of Burma. It was
argued that our new subjects, whether in Burma proper
or in the Shan States, would not understand such a policy,
and that it would have a bad effect on their feelings towards
us. We might dignify it by the names of prudence and
forbearance; they would ascribe it to fear and weakness.
To them we should seem to have lifted a burden too heavy
for our strength. We were afraid of going into places which
the King had held and prepared for us.</p>

<p>This, however, might be disputed, or treated as a question
of sentiment. But the practical objections were evident
and insuperable.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Easternmost Point of the British-Indian Empire.</span><br />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>
<p>Looking to the character of the country lying between
the Salween and the Mekong, it was certain to be the
refuge of all the discontent and outlawry of Burma. Unless
it was ruled by a Government not only loyal and friendly
to us, but thoroughly strong and efficient, this region would
become a base for the operations of every brigand leader
like Twet Nga Lu, or pretender such as Saw Yan Naing,
where they might muster their followers and hatch their
plots to raid British territory when opportunity offered. To
those responsible for the peace and order of Burma such
a prospect was not pleasant.</p>

<p>These arguments prevailed, and it was decided to accept
without flinching the full burden of responsibility which fell
on us as standing in the King of Burma's place.</p>

<p>The States east of the Salween which were under the
King of Burma came under two categories: those which
were governed directly by their own chiefs or Sawbwas,
and those which were subordinate parts of certain Cis-Salween
States. Kang Hung and Kengtung came in the
first class, and were the most important of the Burmese
possessions east of the Salween. Their position may be
roughly judged by the tribute paid to the King and the
contingent they were bound to supply to the royal army.
The tribute consisted of gold blossoms and cups, candles,
bales of silk, ponies, and embroidered pillows; and it was
due not only to the King and the heir-apparent, but to the
members of the Hlutdaw, or Cabinet. Kang Hung sent
tribute every third year, while Kengtung sent nearly thrice
the value every year. The former State furnished a contingent
of 2,500 men, half musketeers and half spearmen,
and maintained seven posts on the southern frontier of from
60 to 100 men. The latter's contingent was of the same
strength; but seven guards, with garrisons of from 50 to
200 men, had to be maintained by Kengtung on the southern
frontier.</p>

<p>Kang Hung was the largest in area of the Trans-Salween
States connected with Burma. The greater and the richer
part lay to the east of the Mekong, and was overlapped
on the north-east and east by Chinese territory. It was
divided into twelve "panna," or townships, six of which lay
on the east and six on the west of the river. The six
<i>panna</i> on the east were more under the influence of China<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
than those on the west. Nevertheless, it is said that when
Upper Burma was annexed there were no Chinese settlers in
the eastern <i>panna</i>, and no interference of any kind by China
with the administration of the country. Although in 1885
the King of Burma, in his secret treaty with the French, purported
to cede Kang Hung to France, he had lost hold of
Kang Hung altogether at that time, and he had no power
then or previously to dispose of it without China's consent,
although China did not meddle with the local Government.</p>

<p>Kengtung, which adjoins Kang Hung on the south, has
had something of a history. About the middle of last
century the Siamese invaded it. They were routed, and
did not care to try a second venture. Later on it was
the first State to revolt against Thebaw's exactions. The
people, led by their chief, attacked the Burman Resident,
and put him and his escort to the sword. The similar
revolt at Möngnai about the same time gave King Thebaw
as much as he could do, and Kengtung was left alone. It
has been related in Chapter XV how the Shan chieftains met
at Kengtung and formed a Confederacy under the Limbin
Prince. The chief of Kengtung had intrigued previously
with the Myingun Prince with the object of inducing him
to be their chief. As he was unable to come, the Limbin
Prince was invited to lead. It was not the Burmese dynasty,
but the person of King Thebaw they wished to be quit of.</p>

<p>When the Limbin Confederacy dissolved and Möngnai
and the leading Cis-Salween States came under the British
flag, the Kengtung Sawbwa should have come with them.
There were, however, influences which kept him aloof. The
chief who had taken the lead against Thebaw had just died.
His son, who was Sawbwa in 1888-9, was a mere boy, only
thirteen years of age. The country between Kengtung and
Möngnai, through which he would have had to pass to meet
Mr. Hildebrand, had been much disturbed and was unsafe.
It was well known that his father had invited the Myingun
Prince to head the revolt against Thebaw. As the party of
resistance to British rule in Burma regarded the Myingun
as their leader, it was possible that Kengtung might not be
welcomed by the British authorities. These apprehensions,
however, would have had little force had it not been for
Saw Waing, the ex-Sawbwa of Lawksawk, who, with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
armed following, had taken refuge in Kengtung, and had
obtained much influence over the young chief. If a representative
from the Chief Commissioner could have gone immediately
to Kengtung he would have submitted at once;
for he had no chance of standing alone, and he knew it. But
it took time to decide our policy, and determine the course
to be followed regarding the easternmost dependencies of
Burma. It was not wonderful that the boy-Sawbwa and
his advisers should await events.</p>

<p>South of Kengtung, lying partly between it and the
Mekong and partly across that river, was a small State
called Chieng Kong. This State was believed at the time
to be subordinate to Kengtung and to follow the fortunes
of the larger State.</p>

<p>The small districts which were formerly governed directly
by Burma had been annexed by Kengtung about the time
of his revolt against the King. They were not of importance,
except that one of them, Hsenyawt, contained the
chief ferry over the Salween and included land on both
banks of the river. The other, Hsenmawng, was a small
circle entirely surrounded by Kengtung land. These two
little tracts had in the King's time been administered by
Burmese officials, probably in connection with the customs
levied on the ferry traffic.</p>

<p>Kengtung had also appropriated the district of Möngpu,
which had belonged to the Möngnai Sawbwa, and an
adjoining tract known as Mönghsat, which Möngnai also
claimed. So far the questions concerned only the interests
of our own feudatories.</p>

<p>Farther to the south, down the east bank of the Salween,
lay four small States&mdash;Möng Tang, Möng Hang, Möng
Kyawt, and Möng Hta. These four districts belonged to
the Cis-Salween Sawbwa of Möngpan. Owing to the
action of the Siamese officials, who attempted to take possession
of them, there was trouble in 1888, and the Superintendent
had been sent across to arrange the disputed points
with representatives of the Siamese authorities. The
Siamese, however, did not choose to appear. They thought,
it may be presumed, that having a bad case, or no case at
all, they had a better chance of success by diplomatic
action. On the spot, and with local evidence at hand to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
rebut them, it would have been difficult to prove their assertions.
Nothing could be done under the circumstances but
to inquire and report the facts. This was done. The
Government of India were satisfied that these divisions
belonged to Burma, and were part of the territory of the
Möngpan Sawbwa. The Chief Commissioner was authorised
to put Möngpan in possession. Accordingly Mr. Scott
visited the districts and formally installed the Sawbwa.
He found that the residents were without exception
Möngpan Shans. There were no Lao inhabitants.</p>

<p>Until the dissolution of the Burmese authority in 1885,
there had been no thought or talk of Siamese interference.
At that time, seeing the chance of advancing their frontier
to the Salween, an ambition they had doubtless cherished,
the Chiengmai officials had ordered the headmen of these
States to appear to swear fealty to Siam. They obeyed the
order as the only means of escaping destruction. They
returned gladly to their hereditary chieftain.</p>

<p>For five weeks after Mr. Scott's visit there was perfect
quiet. How it came about that this settlement was again
disturbed is not quite clear. The Siamese were bent on
advancing their frontier to the Salween up to the southern
boundary of Kengtung. Seeing that Mr. Scott had returned
and had left no evidence of British authority in the
shape of official or garrison, the former game was repeated.
The headmen of the four States were again summoned "to
drink the water of allegiance." Three of them obeyed.
The fourth, Möng Tang, sent a representative and wrote at
the same time to the Möngpan Sawbwa excusing his conduct
on the ground of <i>force majeure</i>, and promising to return
to his lawful lord when order was finally restored.</p>

<p>It was not until some time afterwards that the Siamese
made overt demonstrations by sending armed parties to the
States, but the people were very much alarmed and ceased
all communication with the west of the Salween. This
reopening of the matter was not comprehended by the
Shans, and it did not help to enhance our reputation in the
Shan States.</p>

<p>South-west of these Trans-Salween possessions of Möngpan,
and separated from them by a Siamese district called
Mueng Fai, lie two districts, Mehsakun and Möngmau,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
forming part of the territory of Mawkmai. The history
of these tracts illustrates the fluid state in which the
country on the borders of the Shan States and Siam was
in 1887-9, and for some time previously. Perhaps neither
Burma nor Siam had any established and acknowledged
authority in these regions. In 1823 the chief of Mawkmai,
Né Noi by name, who was distinguished by the appellation of
the Kolan (nine fathom) Sawbwa, was cast into prison in the
Burmese capital. He escaped, and returned to his country
through Eastern Karenni, in much the same way as the
Hsipaw Sawbwa at a later date. But he could not withstand
the Burmese power; and crossing the Salween, with
the aid of Shans from Mawkmai he "carved," to use the
words of Mr. Scott's report, "the two States of Mehsakun
and Möngmau out of the jungle," and settled down there
with his own people.</p>

<p>Here he lived for twenty years, until in 1873 he obtained
a pardon and went back to Mawkmai, leaving a nephew to
govern the Trans-Salween acquisitions. While he was at
Mawkmai he was no peaceful neighbour, but made himself
feared by the Karennis on his south border and by the
Laos on the south and east. So far from being in any
way subordinate to the Siamese officials at Chiengmai, he
attacked the Siamese district of Mehawnghsawn and drove
out the Shan, named Taiktaga San, who had been placed
there by the Chiengmai authorities. He bestowed the district
on his niece, by name Nang Mya. She was a lady with
much force of character, who in England, in the reign of
King George V. would have been a militant suffragette,
and would have made short work of the ministry by marrying
them all out of hand. Nang Mya, probably feeling the
need of local knowledge and connections, dismissed her
first husband, who bore the not very imposing name of
Pu Chang Se, recalled her predecessor, Taiktaga San, from
exile, and made him her consort. When the Kolan (nine
fathom) Sawbwa returned across the Salween to Mawkmai,
she and her new consort transferred their allegiance to the
Siamese Governor at Chiengmai, without opposition on the
part of the Mawkmai Sawbwa. Mehawnghsawn, it may
be explained, is farther from Mawkmai than from Chiengmai,
and the Salween flows between.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>This transaction, however, did not affect the districts of
Mehsakun and Möngmau, which remained under Mawkmai
territory without question until 1888.</p>

<p>When the Red Karen chief, after the old Kolan's death,
attacked Mawkmai, Kun Noi, who was governing Mehsakun
on his uncle's behalf, behaved disloyally to his cousin, the
rightful heir to Kolan, and induced the Karenni to make him
master of Mawkmai. How Kun Hmon was restored to his
position in Mawkmai by a British force has been told above
(Chapter XV, p. 184). He was unable, however, to regain
the two Trans-Salween districts, and it was not convenient
at the moment to send a party across to reinstate him. Kun
Noi, having been ejected from Mawkmai by the British,
turned his thoughts to Siam and opened communications
with the Chiengmai authorities through his cousin, the
lady Nang Mya, who governed at Mehawnghsawn, with the
view of placing himself under their protection. This was
the origin of the Siamese pretensions to the Trans-Salween
districts of Mawkmai. They had no foundation in right.
It had been for some time their ambition to advance their
frontier to the Salween, but as long as Burma had a remnant
of strength, they could not. They thought the time opportune
when the Burmese power had gone and the British
had not yet made good their hold. On the 6th of March,
1889, a band of men, some of whom were militia from
Chiengmai, came and occupied Tahwepon, the chief ferry
on the Salween in Mawkmai territory, and hoisted the
elephant flag of Siam, claiming the whole of the borderland
lying east of the river for the King of Siam.</p>

<p>The position of Eastern Karenni has been explained in
the chapter concerning events in that country. The people
are numerous and all Karen. In the thirty-eight villages in
which they live there are neither Shans nor Laos. The
territory had been for many years in the hands of the Karenni
chief, and was colonized by his people, just as the two districts
north of it had been colonized by Mawkmai. It formed
the most profitable portion of the Karenni State, by reason
of its extensive and valuable teak forests. The capital
required to work the timber was found by British subjects
from Moulmein, the Karennis furnishing the labour. The
timber trade was completely stopped by the Siamese; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
elephants employed on it seized and carried off. The floating
of the timber which had to be sent down to Moulmein
by the Salween was prevented, and communication between
the east and west banks prohibited by them. Such a state
of affairs was most galling to the Karennis and injurious to
the dignity and to the revenues of their chief.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of affairs in 1889, and it became
necessary to take action to prevent further mischief. It
was decided by the Government of India, in communication
with the Foreign Office, to appoint a Commission to survey
the frontier and settle disputed points with representatives
of the Siamese. Accordingly, as soon as the season permitted,
a Commission was formed under Mr. Ney Elias,
C.I.E., as chief. The members of the Commission were
Mr. W. J. Archer, Her Britannic Majesty's Vice-Consul at
Chiengmai, Mr. J. G. (now Sir J. George) Scott, Major
E. G. Barrow (now Sir Edmund Barrow), Captain F. J.
Pink (now Colonel Francis J. Pink, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O.,
Queen's Royal West Surrey Regiment). A survey party
from the Government of India, under Captain H. M.
Jackson, R.E., was attached to the Commission. Surgeon
J. K. Close was appointed to the medical charge, with Dr.
Darwin as his assistant. The escort, commanded by Major
Clarke, O.L.I., was composed of two companies of the
Oxford Light Infantry, two guns of a Mountain Battery,
and a few rifles of the Shan (military police) Levy.</p>

<p>Early in December the Commission met at Fort Stedman,
and marching down through Loikaw and Sawlôn, the
Karenni capital, encamped near Ywathit, at the ferry on the
Salween called Ta Sanglè. Here they had expected to
meet the Commissioners who, it was understood, had been
appointed by the Bangkok Government to represent it. No
one appeared, however, with credentials from Siam.
Whether this was a deliberate act of discourtesy, or only
a failure caused by the general debility of the Siamese
administration, may be questioned. Most probably it was
an instance of the common policy of Orientals and others
with a weak case, who prefer to plead before a distant
and necessarily more ignorant tribunal, rather than to
submit their statements and evidence to a well-informed
officer on the spot. Perhaps, also, the advisers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Siamese Government avoided taking part in the inquiry
in order that they might refuse to be bound by an unwelcome
finding.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, Mr. Elias was forced to
proceed in the absence of the other side. The working
season in these latitudes is short, and to have delayed action
would have played the Siamese game and given them more
time to harass the Karennis and appropriate their property.
Although no final decision could be arrived at, the Commission
could ascertain the facts, survey the country, and
place the matter in a clear light before the Government
of India. At least we should acquire an exact knowledge of
the case, and be able to say what we were fighting about.
The business, therefore, was allowed to proceed.</p>

<p>A standing camp was formed at Ta Sanglè, and three
parties, led by Mr. Ney Elias, Mr. Archer, and Mr. J. G.
Scott, respectively, started to examine and survey the
Karenni country. Ten months had passed since the
Siamese had appeared in these parts. The time occupied
unavoidably in a triangular correspondence between the
Chief Commissioner in Burma, the Government of India
in Simla, and the Foreign Office at Whitehall, had not
been altogether wasted by the Siamese, who had endeavoured
to get the proverbial nine points of the law on their side.
They had established a series of posts along the Salween,
all of them stockaded and flying the white elephant flag
of Siam. In each of these posts were fairly large garrisons
of from fifty to one hundred men, some of them well armed
Siamese troops, others Laos and Shans&mdash;men, these latter,
from the west of the Salween, who had sought refuge in
Siamese territory from the troublous times of the past
years.</p>

<p>It was found that the frontier of Trans-Salween Karenni
was clearly defined by a range running from north to south,
from fifteen to five-and-twenty miles from the Salween.
The inhabitants, almost all Karens, had built their villages
on this frontier range. As they live by the rude method of
cultivation known as <i>Taungya</i>, they frequently move from
one site to another to get fresh ground. The forests are rich
in teak, but the timber was worked not by the Karens,
but by Shans, or by Burmese traders from Moulmein.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Everything went to show that the country had been settled
and opened up by the Red Karens, and that the Siamese
neither had nor pretended to have any rights over it
until the time of our expedition against Sawlapaw. From
inquiries made and from the number of their villages the
Karen population was estimated at between three and
four thousand. The Siamese had taken a very practical
method of marking them for their own. All adult males
without exception had been tattooed on the forearm with
the emblem of an elephant, with a running number added
below. At first it was thought that this might help us
to compute the number of people in the country. But
the tattooing had not been done systematically at the
villages where the people lived, but at markets and ferries
as they chanced to come from the villages around, to
sell their produce or make purchases. Thus while one
man in a village might be branded with the number one
hundred, his neighbour in the same village might be
numbered four hundred. Without visiting every village,
therefore, it was not possible to learn the highest number
reached, and for this there was not time.</p>

<p>Going north to the districts of Möngmau and Mehsakun,
claimed by Mawkmai, Mr. Elias was met by a major in
the Siamese army, who claimed to be a member of the
Commission representing Siam. This gentleman begged
the question in dispute by welcoming Mr. Elias to Siamese
territory, but made no further contribution to its settlement.
The inquiry having convinced the Commission that the
Mawkmai Sawbwa's right to these districts was beyond
doubt, he was permitted to resume possession. He brought
in his officials with an escort of his own Shans, and the
Siamese officers thereupon retired. Mawkmai's possession
was not disturbed again.</p>

<p>In the four States claimed by Möngpan events took a similar
course. An official representing Siam was found encamped
close to Möng Tung, with about one hundred and fifty men.
He was requested to leave, as these States were undoubtedly
British territory and had been formally so declared. He
left without delay or reluctance, and the Möngpan Sawbwa
was put in possession, his nephew being appointed governor
of the four States, and entrusted with the task of restoring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
them to order and prosperity. So far the Commission had
completed their task. As the Siamese had failed to co-operate,
the decisions could not be regarded as final. They
were left, as the Bangkok Government may have intended,
to be reopened and disputed in London. Much information,
however, had been gathered about a country hitherto
unknown, and a solid foundation laid for a lasting settlement
of our frontier with Siam. Captain Jackson's party
had worked with the energy for which he had already won
a reputation in three preceding seasons in the Cis-Salween
States.</p>

<p>"In this his fourth season," wrote the Superintendent
of the Southern Shan States to the Chief Commissioner,
"he had an exceedingly difficult region to survey, and
he has fixed on our charts an area which would probably
have exceeded the powers of any one whose physique was
not in equal proportion to his zeal."</p>

<p>Before the Commission had finished the settlement of
this strip of country from the south border of Eastern
Karenni to the northern frontier of Möng Tung, it had
become evident that if they were to complete their task
the whole body could not visit Kengtung. Mr. Scott, therefore,
was deputed for this purpose, and left early in February.
He decided to start from Möngnai, where he proceeded
in order to procure transport. The lateness of the season
made it above all things necessary to march quickly, impossible
with pack bullocks, the ordinary transport of the Shans,
which make thirty-four stages from Möngnai to Kengtung.
The Panthays (Chinese Mohammedans) with their mules, do
the same journey in twelve days. They march from daylight
to midday, and after a couple of hours' halt go on
till sunset. Mules have the advantage of bullocks in the
matter of gear as well as in speed and endurance. The
loads are fastened not to the saddle, but to a light wooden
frame which fits into grooves on the saddle, and can be
lifted off in a minute and as easily replaced. The process
of loading and unloading is therefore greatly simplified,
and much labour and time saved. Moreover, baggage of
all sorts and shapes can be loaded on mules, whereas
bullocks cannot carry any that will not fit into their
baskets. Then a mule will walk almost as fast as a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
in heavy marching-order, and will cover twelve or fifteen
miles while a bullock is doing his five; so that instead
of waiting for their food after a twelve-mile march until
the bullocks hobble in when the sun is low, the men will
get their food half an hour after they reach camp. But
Mr. Scott has led us away from the business in hand in
his enthusiasm for mules.</p>

<p>Panthay mules are not to be found waiting on a stand
like taxi-cabs. It is not easy to get them for casual work.
Mr. Scott, therefore, was kept some time at Möngnai waiting
for mules, and then could not get enough and had to fill
the gap with elephants. From Möngnai he went up north
by the Nam Teng Valley, crossing the Nam Teng at Ko-up,
where a bamboo bridge had been built over the river. The
villages on both sides of the river had been raided by the
brigand Twet Nga Lu, whose story has been told elsewhere
(<i>vide</i> Chapters XV and XVI).</p>

<p>East of the Nam Teng River in the State of Keng
Tawng, "the country for nearly twenty miles at a
stretch," Mr. Scott reported, "is practically a desert. Yet
all along the road old wells and ruinous monasteries and the
grass-grown skeletons of former paddy-fields, to say nothing
of hill-clearings, showed that formerly there must have been
a large population here.... The handful of people who
have so far returned to Keng Tawng have settled twenty
miles farther south, round the site of the old capital. There
is a magnificent banyan-tree, known far and wide as Mai
Hung Kan, at Maklang.... The adjoining monastery was
burnt by Twet Nga Lu's brigands, and not even the sanctity
of the tree which twenty men could not span, under whose
branches a fair-sized village might be built, has yet been
able to persuade the monks to return. There are not, in
fact, enough of the pious in the neighbourhood to support
them."</p>

<p>Of the next State entered, Keng Hkam, the same story has
to be told. The Nam Pang, a stormy river which rises in the
north near Lashio, flows into the Salween near Keng Hkam.
The valuable portion of this district consists of an extensive
plateau extending along the right bank of the Nam Pang,
where tobacco and sugar grow well, and very fine rice-fields
and extensive groves of palms made the country rich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>The State suffered greatly in the Twet Nga Lu's disturbances.
The old capital was absolutely destroyed, and
nothing now remains but the ruins of fine teak monasteries
and some ornate pagodas absolutely falling to pieces.</p>

<p>The chief had moved to a new town three or four miles off,
but intended, now order had been restored, to build again
on the old site. Many families had emigrated to the east of
the Salween.</p>

<p>This chief, styled <i>Myoza</i>, accompanied Mr. Scott to
Kengtung. His avowed object was to improve his mind by
travel, and to learn English modes of procedure. It afterwards,
however, appeared that he was attracted more by the
fame of the charms of a lady of the Kengtung Royal Family
than by a craving for knowledge. "He was successful in
his wooing," wrote Mr. Scott, "and it may be hoped that
his bride will put an end to the habit which he is developing
of making inconsequent set speeches. Otherwise he is in
great danger of becoming an intolerable young prig."</p>

<p>It is not possible here to follow the journey to Kengtung
march by march. It must suffice to give some idea of
the country through which the party had to go. From
Keng Hkam to the Kaw Ferry on the Salween, the road
was easy enough, the only difficulties being caused by the
passage of the Nam Pang, across which, owing to the nature
of the bed of the stream, the pack animals could not swim,
and had to be ferried over. The Nam Teng, which was one
hundred paces wide and twelve feet deep under the eastern
bank, would have been a cause of delay had not the Shans
thrown a bamboo bridge across the stream. This bridge
built by the villagers, in six days it was said, was crossed
easily and safely by the loaded transport mules. The
bamboo is worth more to the peasants than gold and silver
and precious stones. With it a Burman or Shan can do
almost anything. For offence or defence, for house or
furniture, for carrying water or making a raft, the bamboo is
equally good.</p>

<p>Mr. Scott's party crossed the Salween at the Kaw Ferry,
which is in the small State of Hsenyawt, which is described
as a simple chaos of hills with probably not above a couple
of hundred acres of flat paddy-land in its whole area. The
village, which exists for the ferry rather than for any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
reason, can hardly find room for more than two or three
houses in a cluster, and is consequently scattered over a
square mile or so of broken ground. On the other side of
the Salween it is uninhabited, and the road for some distance
is very difficult, climbing along the side of a gorge through
which the Nam Leng runs. Mr. Scott tells us that the
Panthay traders carry picks and spades to make the road as
they go, and it is only their labour which has kept the route
open. From the ferry the road runs north-east to Hsenmawng,
which is another small State and town under the
same man who governs Hsenyawt. There are two routes
to Kengtung from this place. One, the northern, through
Möng Ping, bears the proud title of <i>Lammadaw</i> (the
royal road), and was always used in Burmese times; but
landslips had made it dangerous for animals, and fighting
between rival leaders, for men. The other road, which kept
more to the south, passing through a district named Möng Pu
Awn, was perhaps longer but better, and was followed by
Mr. Scott. It follows a zigzag course. First north-east,
to Hsenmawng, then south-east to Möng Hsen, then north-west
again to Kengtung. "East of Hsenmawng," writes Mr.
Scott, "is a simple sea of hills, range behind range all the
way to Kengtung. The main ridges run nearly due north
and south, and they with their spurs and sub-features, can
hardly be said to be broken by the valleys of Möng Pu Awn
or of Möng Hsen. It is a constant succession of ascents
and descents the whole way to Kengtung."</p>

<p>The mountains crossed were often of some height, and
between the altitudes of 3,500 and 5,000 feet were covered
with pine forest. The main range of Loi<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Pè Möng, the
great divide between the Salween and the Mekong Valleys,
which averages 6,000 feet, and rises in many places to more
than 7,000, carries no pine forests.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>
<p>"On the spurs and sub-features, which stretch far away to
the west, forming what may be almost called a plateau&mdash;a
very uneven one certainly, cut up by gigantic gullies, and
sprinkled with numerous eminences, but still a rough sort
of tableland&mdash;pine forest is the prevailing growth, and
seems to give place to oak and chestnut above 5,000 feet,
which, however, is about the average of this high-land
plain. Notwithstanding the ruggedness of the country
which is very much like a Brobdingnagian ploughed field,
the road is not by any means bad. It is very fatiguing, but
for a mule-track it is very much better than the roads at
many places in the Western States, where the path climbs
straight up the hillside with a Roman directness of purpose,
or follows stream beds and rocky gorges with a pertinacity
born of an ignorance of shoe-leather. Beyond the Salween
the track follows the line of the spurs, with the result that
one very seldom has a back-breaking climb. The credit of
this natural engineering eye seems to belong rather to the
Panthay and Chinese merchants than to the natives of the
country; for farther south, where the Panthay caravans pass
but seldom, the paths follow the usual Shan system of going
straight from point to point." It was through a country of
this sort that the little party which was to receive the submission
of its chief, and settle his relations with the Sovereign
Power, made its way. With Scott were two other
white men, Captain Pink, of the Queen's Royal West
Surrey Regiment, who was a member of the Commission,
and Dr. Darwin, a civil surgeon, in the service of the
Burman Government. The escort consisted of eighteen old
soldiers, Sikhs of the Shan levy which had lately been taken
over by the army, and as many untrained recruits of the
same corps. There were besides a few Burmese clerks
on Mr. Scott's staff, some servants and camp-followers,
the transport mules with their Panthay drivers, a few elephants&mdash;which
were more imposing though less agile than
the mules&mdash;and lastly the princely wooer in the shape of the
Myoza of Keng Hkam, with a tail of rough spear-men to
give a touch of romance to the cortège. Not a very imposing
embassage, certainly, to represent the majesty of
England, and to require the allegiance of a chief who ruled
over twenty thousand square miles of country. But the
leaders had the right spirit, and not a man with them, from
the trained soldiers to the rough mule-drivers, but marched
with his head high.</p>

<p>The town of Kengtung is about ten miles as the crow
flies from the pass over the Loi Pè Möng.</p>

<p>"It lies in a plain about twenty miles long and perhaps
fifteen broad. To the west and north this is perfectly flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
and under paddy cultivation; to the east and south are low
grassy hills with swamps in the hollows. The town is
built on the western edge of this rolling country and overlooks
the paddy-lands. It is surrounded by a wall about
fifteen feet high, and machicolated at the top." (The wall
and a moat were constructed by the Burman King Alompra
in the eighteenth century.) "The bricks are insufficiently
burnt, the wall is old and therefore crumbled away in many
places, so that it is picturesque rather than formidable;
moreover, some hills to the south-west would enable field-guns
to drop shells wherever they pleased over the <i>enceinte</i>.
The wall follows the line of the rolling ground, and to the
north and south towers above the plain. To the west it
has not this natural advantage, and jungle affords admirable
cover up to the dry ditch which protects it on this side. To
north-east and south swampy ground covers the approach.
The walls measure four and three-quarter miles round, and
have ten gates, which used to be covered by semicircular
arches. Only two of these arches, however, now remain,
both on the eastern face. There is very little level ground
within the walls, and only the northern half of the walled
town is inhabited. Even this portion is so overrun with
trees as to be almost jungle, and there are several large
swamps among the houses. These supply the people with
water to drink and small mud-fish to eat. There are probably
seven or eight hundred houses within the walls, and
many of these are very substantial. Some are entirely built
of brick; some have brick basements and plank walling;
and the number of bamboo houses is very small. All the
better-class houses are roofed with small tiles made locally.
To judge from the Sawbwa's audience-hall, these tiles are
not a very satisfactory protection against rain, but they at
any rate prevent the fires which do such frequent mischief
in other Shan towns. The monasteries are numerous, and
some of them are adorned with elaborate carving and wall
paintings. They are much like the ordinary Burmese or
Shan Kyaung (monastery) in general architecture, but there
is an indefinable suggestion of Tartar influence about them.
This is particularly noticeable in the massive gateways
which immediately suggest the <i>paifang</i> of China."</p>

<p>There was a very large colony of Shan Chinese to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
east of the town. They had large gardens and kept innumerable
goats, pigs, ducks, and fowls.</p>

<p>"Their houses are all built of bamboo, and their villages,
like those of China, are inconceivably dirty, though in their
person the inhabitants are clean enough."</p>

<p>To the industry of these people is due the manufacture
of tiles and of the pottery work, which is sold cheap and of
great variety in Kengtung bazaar. The inhabitants of the
plain in which the city lies were, Mr. Scott estimated,
about twenty thousand. There were some military surveyors
in his party, but owing to the very critical state of
affairs for some time after the city was entered, it was
thought better not to send them out to survey.</p>

<p>Such, briefly, was the city of Kengtung when the small
British party entered its gates on the 14th of March, 1890.
The elephants, although they marched slowly, and may
have been execrated at times on that account, undoubtedly
added pomp to the somewhat insignificant procession which
entered the city. What followed is best told in the words
of Mr. Scott's report. (Report on Southern Shan States
for the year 1889-90.)</p>

<p>"We were met at the edge of the plain by the Tawphaya,
the Sawbwa's cousin and Chief Minister, along with a
number of the principal officials, and marched in procession
to the town. Great part of the road was lined by
villagers, who stood in many places three or four deep
to see us pass. We camped on the site of the old Burmese
post, and were visited almost immediately after our tents
were pitched by the Sawbwa and his half-brother, the Kyem
Meung (heir-apparent). The Sawbwa is sixteen, and looks
older. The Kyem Meung's age is a matter of dispute
between the Ministers, his mother, and himself. Dates
vary over three years, but he looks a good deal younger
than his brother.</p>

<p>"A formal return visit was paid to the Sawbwa next
day. He is building himself a new brick <i>haw</i> (palace),
and the old palace, which is a dingy wooden erection, is
said to be so rickety that it would have infallibly collapsed
with the number of people who were to be present at the
reception. We were therefore received in the court-house,
which looks rather like a railway goods shed outside, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
has been rather highly decorated within. The gilding is
now, however, worn and tawdry. There is a large gold
throne at the farther end, enclosed within a railing, and
reached by folding doors from behind, like the Mandalay
<i>Yazapalin</i>, which it otherwise resembles in construction.
The Sawbwa and his brother sat on chairs in front
of this, outside the railing, and we were placed between
them. There was an enormous gathering of officials both
of the town and the neighbourhood, and of the prominent
merchants of the town, and the conversation was kept up
by these and by the Kyem Meung, for the Sawbwa had
never a word to say beyond Yes or No. The merchants
all talked of the opening up of communications with the
West, and particularly of the construction of a railway.
Trade at present is entirely with China. The old Chiengmai
trade is greatly interfered with, and almost put an
end to by taxations, restrictions, and imposts levied at the
Siamese frontier posts. The general impression received
was that the merchant class and the bulk of the ministers
were delighted with the establishment of British authority
in Kengtung. There is a huge drum near the door of
the audience-hall. It is made of hide stretched on a
wooden frame, and is about the size of a puncheon. This
is said to have been made by the 'hill-people,' but by
what hill-people and where, nobody knew. One stroke
on this <i>Sigyi</i> announces that the Sawbwa has ascended
the throne; two, that he has left the palace to go through
the town; and three strokes summon all officials and armed
men within hearing to the palace without an instant's
delay. We heard three strokes on this drum a good many
times during the next few days.</p>

<p>"On the night of the 16th of March, the second day
after our arrival, there was a <i>pwè</i> (a posture dance) inside
the Sawbwa's enclosure. Eight of our Panthay mule-drivers,
who had been out searching for stray mules, went in after
dark to buy cheroots at the usual bazaar. They were set
on by the Sawbwa's men. Most of them escaped, but one
man was seized, held with his face to the ground and shot
in the back by the Sawbwa himself. He was then set
free and went back to his camp. Two other shots were
heard, and one of the Panthays has never since been seen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
The Panthay camp was some distance away in the plain,
and before I had got more than the excited account of
one of the Panthays, who fled from the palace to our camp,
I had demanded, next morning, an explanation from the
Sawbwa, and the production of the man who had fired
the revolver. I got no explanation, except that the
Sawbwa had issued an order that none of our followers
were to be allowed to go about in the town wearing arms.
In a country where every male above six years wears
a dagger, this was an absurdity. The order had not,
moreover, been communicated to our people. I therefore
demanded the surrender of the offender, and had issued
this order before the Panthays managed to summon up
courage enough to denounce the Sawbwa himself as the
murderer. It was impossible to recede. It was necessary
for British prestige and for our own personal safety to
settle the case. Our followers expected to be massacred
in their beds; the Sawbwa feared that he would be seized
in his palace, and filled it with armed men. For two days
the suspense was rather trying. I then announced that
if my orders were not complied with, I would march down
to the <i>haw</i> the next day. This brought up the Tawpaya
and several other ministers, with a petition that I would
decide the case as it stood. They produced no witnesses,
and did not deny that the Sawbwa was the offender. I
therefore sentenced him to pay Rs. 500 compensation to
the wounded man and Rs. 1,500 if the missing man was
not produced within five days alive and well. This sentence,
I informed them, was a concession to the low state of their
civilization and the ignorance of the Sawbwa. The Rs. 500
were paid a couple of hours afterwards, and the Rs. 1,500 a
few days before we left.</p>

<p>"The incident was all the more embarrassing, because
none of the details of the Sawbwa's relations with the
British Government had been settled. He had been reduced
to such a state of fear that it was only by again threatening
to march down to the <i>haw</i> that I was able to persuade
him to come and discuss the terms under which he received
a <i>sanad</i> of appointment from the British Government.
When he did come, however, his manner was much more
satisfactory, and he accepted in every detail the terms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the <i>sanad</i> and promised to attend future Durbars of the
Shan chiefs. Other matters which had to be arranged
with him concerning his western frontier were also easily
put in train for settlement."</p>

<p>It is impossible to read this brief account without doing
homage to the well-considered audacity of Mr. Scott's
action, which ended once for all any inclination on the
part of Kengtung to resist the British Government.</p>

<p>During the next few days the terms of the Sawbwa's
patent of investiture were finally arranged. In his leisure
time a wealth of information regarding the province and its
wonderful variety of races was acquired by Mr. Scott, which
it is regretted for the reader's sake cannot be given here.</p>

<p>On the 29th of March, three days before the time fixed for
leaving Kengtung, a Durbar was held for the purpose of
formally presenting the chief with his patent of appointment.
It was attended by all the officials connected with
the Kengtung State. The only foreigners present were
the princely wooer from Keng Hkam and the brother-in-law
of the Möngnai Sawbwa. But so large is the area of the
State that the assemblage was as numerous as if it had
been a general Durbar of the Shan States at Fort Stedman.
Mr. Scott improved the occasion by impressing on them
that British supremacy meant peace and trade.</p>

<p>"As is usual with a speech in the Shan States, a running
comment was kept up in different parts of the audience on
the various points enumerated, and on the whole it seemed
that their comprehension was satisfactory and their resolution
praiseworthy. The ministers promised by the Sawbwa
complete obedience to the Chief Commissioner in all matters
connected with the State; and the Sawbwa himself was
divided between admiration for the repeating carbine which
he received as a present and a laudable desire to be
amiable."</p>

<p>The party left Kengtung on their return journey on the
1st of April, and marched back by a southerly route through
the four small States belonging to Möngpan, where some
disputes had arisen which required Mr. Scott's orders.
These questions were finally settled for the time at least
at Möngpan, and Mr. Scott then returned to Fort Stedman,
which he reached after an absence of six months, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
6th of June, 1890. He had been away on this distant work
all the open season of 1889-90. Although the Shan States
in his immediate charge had not been visited by the
Superintendent, there had been no trouble. The Sawbwas
as well as the British administrators were putting aside
warlike things, and devoting their energies to the things
of peace. The Lawksawk chief had done us good service
in 1899 by capturing the Setkya Mintha, a pretender who
had been a nuisance since the annexation. In 1890 he
broke up and captured most of the gang that followed a
noted leader Kyaw Zaw. The growth of wheat and other
crops occupied the minds of other Sawbwas, while the
Chief Commissioner was devising a procedure code to guide
the Shan rulers in administering the law. It was necessary
to frame rules which should secure substantial justice and
at the same time should not be beyond the powers of the
Shan judges to comprehend. Communications between the
States and Burma were vigorously pushed on, although not
quite as fast as the Superintendent wished and in his
enthusiasm thought possible.</p>

<p>The work done in 1889-90 was good and lasting.
Although, owing to the failure of the Siamese Government
to take part in the inquiry, a further Commission had to
be appointed to settle and demarcate the boundary, the
decisions arrived at by Mr. Ney Elias were practically
confirmed, when the final demarcation was made in 1892-3
to some extent by Mr. Hildebrand, but for the most part
by Mr. H. G. A. Leveson, of the Indian Civil Service and
of the Burman Commission. The only difference of importance
was that the minor State of Chieng Kong, which
bestrode the Mekong and was supposed to be more or
less tributary to Kengtung, was, as regards the eastern or
Trans-Mekong portion, of which Möng Hsing was the chief
town, assigned to Siam.</p>

<p>But before the Government at Bangkok had had time
to receive the homage of the Möng Hsing chief, the French
crossed the Menam and obtained the treaty of Chantabun
from Siam, by which everything east of the Mekong passed
to France and Möng Hsing became French.</p>

<p>As to Kang Hung, in arranging matters with China we
transferred all the rights in this State on both sides the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Mekong&mdash;the whole, in fact, of the Sibsong Panna (or twelve
provinces)&mdash;to China, on the condition that she should never
cede any part of it to another power. With an almost
indecent haste, China gave up a portion of the Kang Hung
country to France. As a protest, we refused to pay the
decennial tribute of gold flowers, which had been conceded
to save the face of China after the annexation, and demanded
a revision of the eastern frontier of Burma agreed
with China in 1894. A new agreement was made in 1897
which gave Burma a better boundary. It is not likely that
new difficulties will arise on this side, although the boundary
has not been demarcated. Trouble is more probable on the
north, where no openings should be left. China does not
forget her claim to Burma.</p>

<p>Kengtung showed a proper sense of his duties after Mr.
Scott's lesson to him. The present Sawbwa, who was at
the Delhi Durbar in 1903, is reported to have said to one
of the officers from Burma, "We thought we were great
men, but now we see that we are only monkeys from the
jungle." So Durbars, like other forms of adversity, may
have their uses, and quite as sweet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

BHAMO AND MOGAUNG</h2>


<p>When Upper Burma was annexed the first step towards
the constitution of a well-ordered province was to
parcel out the country into districts of such a size and with
such boundaries that they could be conveniently administered.
The wise course was followed of preserving the old
native divisions, which had probably resulted from the
teaching of experience and the nature of the country and
differences of race. For few innovations vex a people more
than changes in the boundaries of the units of jurisdiction
which touch their daily life. Hence it came to pass that
all the country between 23° 37' N. and the undefined line
dividing Upper Burma from China and Thibet, somewhere
about 28° N., was constituted the charge of a single Deputy
Commissioner, with the China frontier as its eastern
boundary, and as its western limit the Hukawng Valley, the
Upper Chindwin district, and further south the Katha
district. The headquarters of the Deputy Commissioner
and of the military garrison were placed at the town of
Bhamo, from which the district took its name.</p>

<p>The Irrawaddy cuts the district in two from north to
south. The town of Bhamo lies in a plain along the left
bank of the river, midway between two defiles, usually
spoken of as the first and second defile, through which the
waters rushing down from the region of mountains in the
north have cut their way. The river is open all the year
round, as far as Bhamo to large river-steamers. But the
first or northern defile is always difficult, and when the
river is in flood, impassable. Hence Bhamo is the gate of
Upper Burma, and the port for the trade which has existed
for centuries with Western Yunnan. In a very small way
it is the Peshawur of Burma, and for the purpose of
raids and such like the Kachin tribes play the part of
the Pathans on the north-west frontier of India. The
greater part of the district is hilly and covered with
forest; and the Kachins, who form quite a third of the
population, live in the hills.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 393px;">
<a href="images/m284.png"><img src="images/m284-t.png" width="393" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>
<p>It is said that trade follows the Flag. In this case the
reverse is true. The Irrawaddy Flotilla Company had prepared
the way for us here. Bhamo had been the northern
terminus of their steamers since 1869, and for some time
the Government of India had kept a Resident there to
protect the trade. But no attempt had been made to
navigate beyond Bhamo.</p>

<p>In December, 1885, a force was sent up by river to
occupy the town, and an officer of the Burma Commission,
Captain Cooke, accompanied it, and began to establish a
civil administration. No opposition was met with. The
population of the town was not in a position to resist
us. Mixed with the indigenous Burmans and Shans was
a considerable colony of Chinese traders&mdash;some of them
Cantonese who had filtered up from the coast, others hardy
and adventurous men from Yunnan, engaged in the jade and
amber and rubber trades in the northern part of the district.
These foreigners, although they disliked exceedingly our
interference with the opium and liquor traffic, and even
more our attempts in the interests of the troops to improve
their methods of sanitation, were not actively hostile. The
peasantry of a mixed Shan-Burman race, who cultivated
the level country round and below the town, were peacefully
inclined, though shy and timorous. But the Kachin
tribes soon began to show their teeth and to do their best
to make things unpleasant. The policy laid down from the
first for the guidance of the local officers in their dealings
with the Kachins was one of patience and conciliation.
Perhaps too much stress was laid on this. In one case,
certainly, the Deputy Commissioner's anxiety to adhere to
this policy was carried to an extreme, and caused mischief.</p>

<p>It will be convenient to take the northern portion of the
district first&mdash;that part, namely, which begins from 24° 37'
N. and goes right up to the Chinese boundary. It now
forms a separate charge, known as the Myitkyina district,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
but at the time we are writing of, was the Mogaung subdivision
of the Bhamo district, and contained about 10,000
square miles of country, of which two-thirds were, and still
are, forest. The level and valley lands along the Irrawaddy
and its tributaries, mostly on the right bank, are fertile,
yielding rice as the main crop; but even now, after twenty
years of peace, the area cultivated is very small. It is given
in the <i>Burma Gazetteer</i> (vol. ii., p. 123) as twenty-eight
square miles. The area in the hills tilled, after a primitive
method, has not been estimated, but as there are between
twenty and thirty thousand Kachins who live on its produce,
it is probably larger.</p>

<p>Of the wide forest area, part is in the low hill ranges,
part in the plains. Twenty-five years ago, when there was
not a road, the dense undergrowth and bamboo jungle, and
in the lower lands the wide seas of elephant-grass, made the
passage of men and transport animals most difficult and
laborious.</p>

<p>From a fiscal point of view Mogaung was supposed to
be the most important part of the Bhamo district. The
collection of a royalty on jade was farmed in the King's time
for about Rs. 50,000, and there was also an income from
the rubber-trees, mostly wild, but to a small extent cultivated.</p>

<p>In March, 1886, a force accompanied by Captain Cooke,
the Deputy Commissioner, made its way to Mogaung. The
Deputy Commissioner reported that the "country was then,
for the most part, brought under control and settled
administration." This was a figurative and official way
of saying that a person of local influence, by name Maung
Kala, had been recognized and put in charge as a magistrate
in the British service.</p>

<p>After a very brief visit the Deputy Commissioner with
the troops went back to Bhamo, and left Maung Kala to
carry on the government as he best could, without police
and with no military support nearer than Bhamo, which is
at the least 150 miles from Mogaung, whether the journey
is made by water or land. Even a handful of troops,
lightly equipped, could not have been sent up in less than
a fortnight. There was no telegraph to Mogaung. Maung
Kala belonged to a family of great local influence, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
held office for several generations, and was reputed to be
of Chinese descent. But whatever his influence, he was
sure to make enemies in his endeavours to keep order and
to collect revenues, and there was no visible force behind
him. His reign was short, and he was soon assassinated.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>A Burman official was sent up from Bhamo by the
Deputy Commissioner to succeed the murdered man. He
soon found that he was not wanted at Mogaung and he
retired to Sinbo, whence he could at least make a show of
controlling the river-side villages. Po Saw, the son of
Maung Kala, was then appointed by the people to his
father's post, and whatever order or show of government
there was in the country was due to him. Subsequently,
in consequence of his having summarily executed a pretender
who had endeavoured to impose himself on the
people, the Deputy Commissioner recognised Po Saw's
authority and withdrew the Burman. Nevertheless, it
cannot be said that the British Government had jurisdiction
in Mogaung. No revenue was collected&mdash;at least,
none was paid into the Bhamo treasury. In this respect,
however, Mogaung was little worse than the southern
portion of the district which was administered by the
Deputy Commissioner himself, supported by the garrison
at Bhamo. In September, 1886, Major Cooke reported:
"This district has, I believe, been one of the quietest
districts in Upper Burma. The tranquillity of the district
is in a great measure due to the fact that no real attempt
was made to collect the revenue until July or August."
Even the tranquillity so purchased was, however, only
comparative, and the soldiers had quite enough to do. In
the open season of 1886-7 it was not found possible to give
men for an effective expedition to the north. Things had
to be allowed to take their own course for the time. The
Administration had no choice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>
<p>Early in 1887, however, the military police began to
arrive from India, and in the spring of that year five
companies, mainly Gurkhas, under the command of Lieutenant
O'Donnell, were posted to Bhamo. This strengthened
the hands of the civil administration. It was then too late
to start an expedition to Mogaung. But Lieutenant
O'Donnell was sent up to Sinbo, a village of some
importance on the right bank of the Irrawaddy, just
above the first defile. Here a strong stockade was built and
a Gurkha garrison posted in it. An Assistant Commissioner
also, Mr. Twomey, was sent to watch the course of
events in the north.</p>

<p>There were three routes by which Mogaung could be
reached from Bhamo. One was by going up the Irrawaddy
and turning into the Mogaung River, on which lies the town.
This was quite possible for a very small force which had
not to carry all its supplies and transport. The object,
however, was not merely to reach Mogaung, but to go to
the jade-mines and explore the country. Since an explorer
(Lieutenant Bayfield) made his way to the mines in 1838,
no European had visited them. Nothing was accurately
known of the nature of the country, of the supplies it
afforded, or of the numbers and temper of the Kachin tribes
which dominated it. All that could be gathered from the
Chinese and others showed that there would be much
difficulty in all these matters. It was suspected that the
Chinese were disposed to magnify the difficulties. Nevertheless
it was necessary that the force should be prepared
for all emergencies, and should be in every respect self-sufficing.
Hence the river route was considered impracticable.</p>

<p>Another way was to land the force at Katha and march
up through Mohnyin. Our knowledge of the route between
Mohnyin and Mogaung also was imperfect. It was not
under our control, and a force passing up would have
to take everything with it. The third route was by the
left bank of the Irrawaddy. It had this advantage, that
although the marching would be difficult, boats could
follow the force up the river, could meet it at fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
points, and could carry a large quantity of the supplies,
certainly as far as Sinbo and probably in the smaller craft
as far as Mogaung. After much consideration it was
decided to send the expedition by this route. A fortified
post was to be established at Mogaung, to be held by
the military police, to serve as a base for the advance of the
force to the jade-mines and other parts.</p>

<p>Much care was given to the composition and equipment
of the force<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> by the General commanding in Upper
Burma, Sir George White. It was necessary that it
should be prepared for all emergencies; that it should
carry with it supplies for the whole time of its absence
from Bhamo; that it should be able to move, as occasion
required, either by land or water, and be ready to make
its own roads and bridges. It must be strong enough
to fight its own way and repel attacks; and at the same
time the numbers of the force were limited by the
necessity of carrying its own food and of keeping the
transport train from becoming too large.</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner selected Major Adamson, the
Deputy Commissioner at Bhamo, to go with the force.
To him was entrusted the task of dealing with the
Kachins and of establishing the authority of the British
Government. He had served for thirteen years in Lower
Burma, and was known as one of the best officers in the
Commission. He fully justified the confidence placed in him.</p>

<p>Some time before the expedition started, Major Adamson
summoned Po Saw from Mogaung to meet him at
Sinbo. He came accompanied by many of the chief Shan
residents and Chinese merchants. He promised to obey
the Deputy Commissioner's orders. The Deputy Commissioner
then formally appointed him to be magistrate
of Mogaung in his father's room and from the date of
his father's death, and paid him a large sum as arrears
of salary. He was then dismissed, with orders to clear
the roads of jungle and collect supplies for the troops.
He was instructed also to summon all the Kachin
chiefs connected with the jade-mines to meet the representatives
of the British Government at Mogaung. All
this Po Saw readily promised to perform. Major Adamson
went back to Bhamo well pleased with his willingness to
help and believing in the loyalty of his intentions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>
<p>All preparations having been completed, the expedition
marched from Bhamo on the 27th, by the north gate of
the town. It was for these parts an unusually large and
well-found force, and impressed the townspeople who
crowded to witness its departure. It consisted of the
following troops: Cheshire Regiment, 50 rifles, under
Captain Armstrong; Kelati-Ghilzai Regiment, 101 rifles,
under Lieutenant Morton; Mounted Infantry, 25 rifles;
Bhamo Military Police (Gurkhas), 500 rifles, under Lieutenant
O'Donnell;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Mountain Battery (Bengal), 2 guns,
under Captain Triscott,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> R.A. Captain Clements was in
charge of the commissariat.</p>

<p>The land transport consisted of 350 pack-mules with
drivers and two elephants, who were sent back after a
few marches, as they proved to be useless. A fleet of
three steam launches and thirty-three large country
boats, with supplies, was sent up by river, with a force of
sixty-six Native Infantry, under a native officer, on the
launches.</p>

<p>Captain Triscott, R.A., with Lieutenant Williams, R.A.,
as his staff officer, was in command of the whole force.</p>

<p>A Roman Catholic missionary who spoke Shan and
Kachin accompanied the expedition as interpreter. A
survey party to map the country, a forest officer to
report on the forests, and Mr. Warry, the Chinese adviser
to the Chief Commissioner, made the staff complete.</p>

<p>The march up the left bank of the Irrawaddy was
difficult. There were two considerable streams, the
Taeping and the Molé, affluents of the Irrawaddy, to be
crossed in the first few marches. These rivers, however,
caused comparatively little delay. The track kept as
near as possible to the course of the Irrawaddy. Sometimes
it crept along close to the river-bank, across numerous
spurs separated by small streams flowing into the main
river. The ascents and descents were very steep, and to
make them passable for laden animals much jungle-cutting
and road-making had to be done. Sometimes the
gradients were so steep as to necessitate the cutting of
zigzag paths. At times the animals had to be taken
up the steep banks and into the forests in order to find
a road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 2nd of January the camping-ground was on a
sandy spit by the river-bank, at a village called Nanti.
Here the steam-launches and the thirty-three boats met
the land columns. On the 4th the march lay along the
side of the first defile, where the river flows between rocky
banks. The laden animals found easier going here, as
there was no rank vegetation; but it was slow work, as
paths had to be cut for them on the steep sides of the
beds of dry streams which had frequently to be crossed.
On the 4th, after leaving the defile behind, the force
debouched on sandy level ground close to the stream, and
halted at the village of Manhé, where the column had to
cross the Irrawaddy. The headman of Sinbo, with some
fourscore men and half as many boats which he had brought
down by the Deputy Commissioner's orders, to help in the
work, was waiting. Next day was devoted to the crossing.
At 7 a.m. it began, and by half-past 3 p.m. the last man
was landed on the right bank.</p>

<p>The Irrawaddy at this place and at this time of the
year is three hundred yards wide, with a current of about
two miles an hour. The formation of the river-bed,
the broad sloping banks of sand and gravel, and at places
the depth of water close to the side, made the work simple
enough, however laborious. The two launches could come
alongside the bank, and the artillery and infantry, with
arms and ammunition, were taken over in them. Then
came the baggage animals, who were made to swim the
river in batches of four or five at a time. A canoe, with
one Burman boatman in the bow, was drawn up alongside
the bank, with the bow against the stream. Then four
or five men, each leading an animal, passed round to the
stern of the boat and seated themselves in the canoe
holding the animals by their leading-ropes. As soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
they were seated a second boatman took his stand in the
stern. The bow was shoved off and the canoe punted
across the river by the two boatmen. Thus the animals
were swimming up-stream astern of the canoe, and were
not in danger of being forced by the current against it.
Three hundred and fifty animals swam the river in this
manner, and not one was drowned or hurt.</p>

<p>The column was now on the right bank of the Irrawaddy.
The next march brought them to Sinbo, where a garrison
of military police was already established in a stockade,
near to which a large camping-ground had been cleared for
the troops. Supplies from Bhamo had been landed and
stored, and the commissariat staff was busied in arranging
for their transport to Mogaung. The fleet had also arrived
before the column. The launches being unable, owing
to the shallowness of the river, to get up beyond Sinbo,
were sent back to Bhamo.</p>

<p>The next two marches, partly through forests partly
across plains cropped here and there with rice, brought the
force to the bank of the Mogaung stream. The water
was deep and the current ran very strong. The crossing
of this little river gave more trouble than the passage of
the Irrawaddy. For Po Saw's promises proved false. He
had made no preparations and sent down neither men nor
boats. However, three or four boats were found at a
village higher up the stream. Teak logs were lying about.
Rafts were made; and the guns and commissariat stores
taken over. There were not enough boats to tow the large
number of pack-animals across. Mules and ponies were
driven into the water in herds and forced to make their
way to the other bank, which unluckily was very steep
with a muddy bottom. Nevertheless they all got over
except one, but many were very spent and were brought up
the bank with difficulty.</p>

<p>The road now lay on the left, or east, bank of the river,
and entered a country of which nothing was known.
It was dominated by the Kachin chief of the neighbouring
hills, from whom the inhabitants had to purchase protection&mdash;in
plain English, immunity, to some small extent,
from murder and robbery. As they had been forced at
the same time to pay taxes to the Burmese officials,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
they had suffered much, and many of the villages were
deserted.</p>

<p>The failure of Po Saw to carry out Major Adamson's
instructions gave rise to some anxiety. Treachery was
feared, and precautions were taken against surprise. The
road was now in parts very difficult, over steep forest-covered
hills running down close to the Mogaung River,
and intersected by many steep ravines. Progress was slow,
as the way had to be cleared of bamboo and other undergrowth
before the pack-animals could pass. In places on
reaching the proposed halting-place it was found to be a
small, confined spot, and the ground had to be cleared before
the camp could be pitched. A party of Chinese Shans on
their way to Mogaung joined the camp at night, and were
engaged to accompany the force and help to clear the road,
for which they were well paid.</p>

<p>After some sixteen miles of difficult ground, which was
covered in two marches, the column struck the river
again near Tapaw. Here the headman advised Major
Adamson to cross to the right bank again, as the land
road to Mogaung was only five or six miles, whereas the
river made a detour of double that distance, first going
north and then coming back to the south-east. There
were no boats to be had here. After some consideration
Captain Triscott and Major Adamson decided that it was
advisable to send to Mogaung and summon Po Saw. They
had heard from a Kachin Sawbwa whom they met on the
road that the Chinaman who farmed the jade-mine revenue
had been murdered, and they were now told at Tapaw
that an Englishman had passed down-stream in urgent
haste.</p>

<p>Here we must go back to Mr. Warry's movements. It
has been said above that Mr. Warry, the adviser on Chinese
affairs, had been appointed to go with the expedition. He
belonged to the Chinese Consular Service, spoke Chinese
well, and understood that difficult people as well as an
Englishman can. He was on most friendly terms with
the Chinese in Burma, and could trust himself to them
without fear. It appears that instead of marching with
Major Adamson, as it was intended, he had gone by himself
with some Chinamen by the river. When the expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
arrived at Sinbo it was found that Warry had gone on in
his boat, meaning to travel up the Mogaung stream. His
attempt to go ahead of the expedition, if that had been
his purpose, was foiled by the refusal of his Chinamen to
attempt the ascent of the Mogaung until they had learnt
that the column had preceded them.</p>

<p>Hence on the 12th of January he was in his boat on
the Mogaung, some seven or eight miles in rear of the
marching column, when he met Mr. Rimmer, a commander
in the Irrawaddy flotilla's service, coming down the stream
as fast as his men could paddle. Rimmer had in his boat
a Chinaman very badly wounded in the head. It was Lon
Pein, who had been at one time the farmer of the jade-mine
taxes under the King's Government. Rimmer's story
was that he had pushed on to the town of Mogaung alone,
for the purpose of examining the waterway. He reached
the town on the 19th of January, and having accomplished
his object was about to return at once when Lon Pein
came to him and told him that he feared an attack by Po
Saw's men, who sought his life. He implored Rimmer to
stay and help to defend him until the troops should arrive.
The people of the town appeared to be friendly enough.
But believing that Lon Pein's life was in danger, he chivalrously
agreed to stay. He took up his quarters in the
Chinaman's house, and they made ready in such manner
as they could to resist an attack. Rimmer was armed with
a rifle, and Lon Pein, it may be presumed, had fire-arms of
some sort. They had not long to wait.</p>

<p>At midnight of the 10th a body of ruffians besieged the
house with more vigour even than the police led by the
Home Secretary against the house in Sidney Street. The
house was of the kind usual in the country, raised on piles
with a floor none too closely fitted. The assailants got
underneath and fired through the floor, and thrust spears
wherever they could find an opening. Early in the fight
Lon Pein fell wounded in the head, and never recovered
consciousness. Rimmer's rifle was shot in two, and his
knee was grazed by a ball. However, he continued to hold
out until dawn, when the assailants made off. Next day
he managed to find his boat and, with the assistance of
some town's-people, to carry Lon Pein to it. The inhabitants
expressed their sympathy and regret, but did not
explain their failure to help him. Po Saw, it appeared, had
left Mogaung the day before, but Rimmer believed that
Lon Pein had good cause for holding him responsible for
the attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Warry persuaded Rimmer to return with him to the
protection of the troops, and they joined the column on
the 13th, before it left Tapaw, and entered Mogaung with
it on the 14th of January. Evidently there was mischief
on foot. The leaders of the expedition, on hearing the
story, decided that before advancing further it would be
wise to make Po Saw show his hand. The difficulty was
to get a trustworthy man to carry a message to Mogaung.
There was a Mussulman, a native of India, who had come
up as an interpreter, with the force, Safdar Ali by name.
He might have been a descendant of Sinbad the Sailor, for
he had led a life of travel and adventure. He had traded
in jade, and was familiar with many parts of the country.
He spoke Burmese, Shan, and Kachin, in addition to his
native Hindustani, and he had taken wives of the daughters
of Heth in most of the bigger places. In consequence, or
in spite, of these alliances he was on good terms with the
people about, and could obtain intelligence of local affairs.
Safdar Ali volunteered to take a letter to Po Saw, and with
a native to show him the shortest road, he departed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Captain Triscott and Major Adamson, with
some Mounted Infantry, had gone out to examine the track,
and found that for four or five miles it crossed a rice plain
cut up by numerous muddy ditches which the baggage
animals could not get over. Beyond this rice-ground rose
some hills, at the foot of which was a morass, which the
column would find very difficult to pass. They turned
back to the camp, therefore, to collect labour to make the
road passable. Safdar Ali, on his way back from Mogaung,
overtook them, and reported that Po Saw had disappeared
after the Chinaman's murder, and had gone, it was said,
to raise the Kachins nearest to Mogaung. This was not
cheering news, as Po Saw's influence with the Kachins had
been relied upon as the means of establishing peaceable
relations with them.</p>

<p>However, the other officials of the town had been helpful;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
boats had been sent down to Tapaw, and before the day
ended, the <i>nakan</i>, or deputy magistrate, attended by the
Kyaung Tagas and Payatagas (builders of monasteries and
pagodas), arrived to pay their respects. They were reprimanded
by Major Adamson for their neglect, and were
directed to take steps at once to make the road passable.
The poor men were evidently in fear and trembling, dreading
the vengeance of Po Saw on the one hand and the
wrath of the British Government on the other. However,
the march next day was made without great difficulty: the
ditches were filled up or bridged. The swamp proved a
greater obstacle. Luckily there was an abundance of
elephant-grass hard by. This was cut, and being spread
thickly on the surface of the swamp, made a passable
road.</p>

<p>After climbing the hill, the pagodas and monasteries
of Mogaung became visible; and when the level ground
round the town was reached, a number of the chief people
were seen, who had come out to meet the British force
and make their submission. On reaching the gates a conference
was held with these, while the town was reconnoitred
by the soldiers for a suitable camping-place.</p>

<p>The burgesses were evidently suffering from great fears.
They dreaded the Kachins, to raise whom was the design
of Po Saw. Under these circumstances it comforted them
to learn that the British had come to stay, and that their
town would not be left again without an English officer
and a sufficient garrison. Major Adamson then proclaimed
the offer of a reward of 1,000 rupees for the discovery and
arrest of the murderer of Lon Pein, the Chinaman. He
told them to have no fear of the British soldiers, and
assured them that if the Myo-ôk Po Saw would return to
his duty even now, he would be forgiven and restored to
office. By this time, a good site having been found on a
sand-bank at the upper end of the town, the whole column
marched through the main street, that all might see its
strength, and established the camp there.</p>

<p>Mogaung<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> was once the capital of a considerable Shan
principality. In 1888 it could count only about three
hundred houses. Standing on the bank at the confluence
of two streams, it is washed by water on two sides. On
the other two sides it was defended by a teak palisade in
bad repair. The town is well planned, being, like Rangoon
and Mandalay, laid out in squares, with brick-paved roads
at right angles to each other, one main road, likewise paved,
running through the middle. Many pagodas, substantial
structures of brick, and large and handsome monasteries
of teak, ornament the inside of the town and also the
spaces outside the walls. A Buddhist bishop, with jurisdiction
over the whole of the north part of the Bhamo district,
had his seat at Mogaung in 1887-8.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>
<p>In the centre of the town were some very good houses
belonging to the wealthier residents, and at the upper end
the Chinese&mdash;who formed, as they do now, a large and
important class of the inhabitants&mdash;had their quarters and
their temple. Most of the trade in jade and rubber was
in their hands, and their houses were as uncleanly here
as in other towns of Burma. One of their chief employments
was the manufacture of arrack, which they sold to
the town's-people. The shops in their quarter reeked of
it. Whatever the Indian Temperance Society may think,
we cannot be accused of introducing alcohol or the vice
of drunkenness into these regions. Orders were at once
issued against selling liquor to the British soldiers. These
orders were treated with indifference until a Chinaman was
caught in the act. He was promptly flogged, and there
were no more cases of the kind. Another race found at
Mogaung was the cross-breeds between Chinese and Shans.
"We noticed," says Major Adamson (short account, p. 27),
"very many Chinese Shans.... They are strange, wild-looking
people, as a rule rather short in size, but often
strong and wiry. They are invariably dressed in a blue
cotton jacket and loose blue Chinese trousers, and they
wear their hair in a sort of long tail behind, more or less
after the fashion of Chinese. They are each armed with
a long sword, and as a rule each carries a bag, in which
he keeps his eating utensils, food, and blanket."</p>

<p>In the river in front of Mogaung is an island, where
the boats which bring jade and rubber from the north,
and all sorts of miscellaneous merchandise from Bhamo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
were moored. A small bamboo bridge gave connection with
the mainland. "The island is looked upon as a place
of safety in the event of the Kachins attacking the town.
Many of the villagers keep their valuables in boats for
protection, and some women and children go nightly to
sleep in the boats, where they consider they are safer than
in their houses (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 28)."</p>

<p>It was Major Adamson's duty to get into touch with
the people, and procure the necessary intelligence concerning
local politics and conditions. There was a man of
influence in the town called Shwè Gya, who had been
appointed by Major Cooke to be the <i>nakan</i>, or deputy,
when Maung Kala was recognized as Myo-ôk. He could
not get on with Po Saw when that person succeeded to
power, and retired into private life. Shwè Gya was a man
of some note and of strong individuality. He was a cross-breed
between a Kachin father and an Assamese mother.
But he had adopted the dress, habits, and religion of the
Burmese Shans. He had been a soldier at one time, and
understood Kachin tactics well. Being able to appreciate
the power of the English, he threw in his lot with them.
This man Major Adamson took into his confidence, and
found him most useful and most loyal.</p>

<p>It was necessary for Adamson to be open to all comers
and at all times. As this was not possible within the camp,
he moved his quarters to a rest-house in the town, taking
a small British guard for his protection. On Sunday, the
15th, his mind was relieved by learning that Po Saw
had returned. A Durbar was arranged, to which all the
notables were summoned. The officers of the force being
present, Major Adamson received Po Saw formally, and
after explaining the objects of the expedition and the
general policy of the British Government, namely the
establishment of peace and the encouragement of trade,
he censured the Myo-ôk for his conduct, and called on him
to explain it. Po Saw alleged that fear of being called
to account for Lon Pein's murder had been the reason
of his flight. Major Adamson accepted the excuse, and
restored him to office. At the same time he assured the
people that no one should be prosecuted for offences against
the British Government committed before the arrival of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the expedition, except those who had been parties to the
murder of the Chinaman.</p>

<p>O'Donnell and his police, who had fallen behind the
column owing to the boats with their supplies having been
delayed, had now arrived, and the work of building a
fort for their occupation was begun. A site was chosen
on a piece of ground in the middle of the town, bounded
on one side by the river, of which the banks were very
steep and formed a natural defence, leaving the other
sides to be protected by palisades.</p>

<p>The mornings now were very cold and foggy, the thermometer
falling to 45° or 50°. About nine o'clock the fog
cleared off, and the climate was delightful. The soldiers
were naturally eager to move. They were eating up their
stores, and if the Kachins meant mischief the less time
they had to prepare it, the better. A council of war was
held. Major Adamson wished to wait until the Kachins
had had time to arrive. His instructions were to avoid
hostilities with the Kachin chiefs if possible. Po Saw had
not summoned them to meet him as he had been ordered;
the letters from the British Representative were only now
reaching them. The Chinese, through Mr. Warry, also
strongly urged delay. Moreover, nothing was yet known
about the road to the jade-mines; and as it was found
that, contrary to expectation, paddy for the transport
animals could be procured from the villages in the neighbourhood,
the arguments against delay lost some of their
force. The council decided, after discussion, to halt for ten
days.</p>

<p>During the next few days the chief work was the collection
of materials for the fort and its construction, which
was rapidly pushed on by Captain O'Donnell. Houses were
also put in hand for the officers who were to remain in
Mogaung, namely the Commandant of military police,
the Assistant Commissioner, and a surgeon. Surveys were
made of the neighbouring country, information about the
roads and villages collected, and in short every preparation
made for the advance.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of January, Shwè Gya reported to Major
Adamson that the Myo-ôk Po Saw had disappeared once
more. His conduct since his reinstatement had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
good. It was decided to capture him if possible, and keep
him a prisoner. He was reported to be in a village about
five miles away. Taking fifty men and some mounted
police, under the command of Captain Armstrong, of the
Cheshire Regiment, Adamson descended on the village,
surrounded it, and searched every house. There was no
trace of Po Saw; but a man known to be in his service,
and another who was recognized to be Bo Ti, his right-hand
man, were made prisoners.</p>

<p>The final disappearance of Po Saw upset Major Adamson's
plans. It was idle to expect that the influential
Kachin chiefs would now come in. It was necessary to
appoint a man to carry on the duties of the Myo-ôk. Shwè
Gya was the best man, but he was not a Shan and the
people would not have accepted him. With the consent
of the townsfolk another member of Maung Kala's family
was chosen and placed in authority, with Shwè Gya as
the deputy and real working man. All this was done in
public, and explained to the people. At this time some
letters of a friendly tone came in, with presents from some
Kachin chiefs whose hills were on the road to the jade-mines.</p>

<p>The time had come now for an advance. The fort was
ready for occupation, and was defended by a substantial
bamboo palisade, Captain O'Donnell, with all his police
except a detachment of seventy-five, who formed part of
the expeditionary force, were left to garrison it. Mr.
Twomey, Assistant Commissioner, was placed in administrative
charge, and orders were left for the despatch of Bo
Ti and the other prisoner to Bhamo. On the 26th of
January the march began. The troops forming the column
under Captain Triscott's command were:&mdash;</p>

<p>A field-hospital, under Surgeon-Major Barron, and a train
of transport animals with provisions and commissariat
stores for seven days, completed his equipment. Mr. Warry,
a survey party, a forest officer, the Roman Catholic priest
who acted as interpreter, Safdar Ali, and the new Myo-ôk,
Poh Myah, with Shwè Gya, the deputy, and some armed
followers, accompanied Major Adamson. Supplies were
forwarded up by river to Kamaing, the first principal
halting-place, thirty-three miles from Mogaung.</p>

<p>Before the force left a reconnoitring party had been sent
up to Kamaing, and had reported the road to be very
difficult. The report was not found to be exaggerated.
Marching through elephant-grass and thick forest, which
hid everything except the immediate neighbourhood, a
hardly visible path, obstructed often by huge fallen trees;
camping-grounds which had to be laboriously cleared of
elephant-grass<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and undergrowth, before standing-room
could be found for the animals or resting-place for the men,
with sometimes heavy rain which drenched every one,
made the march anything but pleasant. All hardships,
however, were born with cheerfulness; and as the country
was new and unexplored, and there was a chance of a fight
at any time, the men were full of spirit. They and their
officers were true soldiers.</p>

<p>On the 30th the stream on the opposite bank of which
lay Kamaing was reached. It ran deep, and the banks
were precipitous. Fortunately, it was only about the width
of a cricket pitch. Trees were felled and elephant-grass
cut, and with the aid of a big trunk found sticking up in
the bed of the river, a bridge was made, over which the
whole force, laden animals and all, safely crossed. "Kamaing,"
writes Major Adamson, "is splendidly situated on a small
hill, close to the river, at the point where its two main
branches unite, the larger branch, the Nampoung, coming
from the Indawgyi Lake in the south-west" (ibid., p. 40).
It had been a flourishing town, as the still remaining
monasteries and pagodas proved. These religious buildings
were, however, deserted, the last monk having died a
year before. Of the whole town only a few houses remained.
The place had shared the fate of all this country in the
Kachin rebellion of 1883. There were still a few shops,
however, where Manchester goods could be bought, and
articles of food for daily use were to be had. Country
spirits and opium were also on sale.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>
<p>Here letters came in from the two brothers who ruled
the hills in which the jade-mines are situated. They were
called Kansi Naung and Kansi Hla. Their tone was
friendly, though they wrote with the hope of preventing
the advance of our people from Mogaung. Answers were
sent by mounted messengers, saying that the force was
already at Kamaing and would continue its march next
day, and assuring the Sawbwas of our peaceable intentions.</p>

<p>Starting from Kamaing on the 31st of January, the bank
of the Indaw River was reached after some of the most
difficult marches made during the expedition. The path
was passable for men but not for a long line of laden
animals. It was very swampy, with tall elephant-grass on
each side, which had been set on fire to make the track
passable. The men had to force their way through the
charred stalks, and as there was a heavy fog at the time
"the faces and clothes of the whole column were speedily
as black as if they had been down a coal-mine." (Short
account, p. 36.) For some distance every yard of the road
had to be made by cutting down the tall, coarse grass and
spreading it on the surface of the swamp until it would bear
the weight of the animals. So they made their way, always
through the tall grass, until the Indaw River was struck.
Here it was decided to form a defensible camp, in which all
superfluous animals, stores, and tents should be left, with a
sufficient garrison to guard them, while the main body
pushed on to the jade-mines. After their experience of the
country, it was held to be dangerous to move with the whole
train if there was any likelihood of fighting. Two days
were occupied in preparing this camp, in getting some
portion of the road cleared in advance, and in holding
communication with a neighbouring Kachin Sawbwa.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of February the reduced column, in light
fighting order, left Kamaing with seven days' provisions,
loaded on some hundred and twenty-five mules. Each man
carried two days' rations besides. Everything that could
be done without, including tents, was left in the camp.
It was as well, for the road continued difficult, and every
bit of ground at the halting-places for the night had to be
cleared. The march was sometimes in the bed of a stream
sometimes through dense cane jungle growing in swamp.
Hard work in deep mud, from which all sorts of noxious
vapours rose, caused the men to sweat profusely, and
exhausted the animals. Fortunately, through the medium
of Shwè Gya, Major Adamson persuaded some of the
Kachin villagers to approach him, and their services were
hired for road clearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 6th messengers from the jade-mine Sawbwas,
Kansi Naung and Kansi Hla, were met, carrying letters for
the Deputy Commissioner. The letters were quite friendly
in tone, and invited the British force to halt on the bank
of the Uyu River, where there were grass and water in plenty.
Major Adamson was much relieved to get this communication,
as it seemed to give promise of a peaceable visit to the
mines.</p>

<p>The road ascended now through forest and thick bamboo
undergrowth, and was very fatiguing. For the first time
men were met carrying down loads of jade stone. The
watershed between the Chindwin and the Irrawaddy was
crossed, and the road then descended into an open plateau,
out of the dense and dismal forest through which our
march of seven miles had been. From 7 a.m. till 2 p.m.
we had been steadily marching, but we had only been able
to accomplish seven miles. Heavy rain fell that night
and turned the camping-ground into a bog, and made the
road for next day (February 6th) very heavy. The mud
and water reached to the bellies of the mules, and in places
the column was forced to leave the path and cut a new way
through the forest. The Namthein, an affluent of the Uyu,
had to be crossed several times, the water being up to a
man's knee and the bed of the stream 50 yards broad.</p>

<p>At midday the weary force encamped on a tongue of land
at the junction of the Namthein and Uyu Rivers. The camp
was on a lovely spot. It faced southwards, and commanded
a view of the junction of the two streams. On the right
was the Uyu, a beautiful stream of from 75 to 100 yards
from bank to bank, "as clear as crystal, and alive with fish,
which kept rising to the surface in the evening, like trout
in an English stream. The bed was generally rocky, full
of large water-worn boulders; but for a short distance above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
our camp there was a very deep pool under the opposite
bank, while the shore on our side was sandy and gravelly,
and sloped very gradually towards the deep part.... The
spot which we selected for a camp was a beautiful triangular
piece of ground, covered with short grass and a
few bushes on the northern portion, and with a long tongue
of shingle and sand stretching southwards to the place
where the streams met."</p>

<p>In this pleasant place came a further letter to the
leaders of the expedition from Kansi Naung, saying that
he had given orders that the English should be treated well,
and promising to come himself with presents.</p>

<p>Next day, however, brought only disappointment. A
letter came from Kansi Naung saying that illness prevented
him from keeping his promise. Other signs indicated
that all was not right, and Shwè Gya, who had been
hopeful hitherto, lost heart. The military leaders were for
good reasons in favour of immediate action. Major Adamson,
however, took the responsibility of giving Kansi Naung
more time, and wrote to him peremptorily, saying that they
could not wait, and that he must come in. On the 8th of
February news came that Kansi Naung was at a village
on the opposite side of the river, not a mile off. Shwè Gya
was asked to go across to see him. But he declined, saying
that he knew Kachins were on his track to murder him.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
From two men who came across from the Sawbwa's camp,
one of whom Major Adamson had met in Mogaung, it was
learnt that emissaries from Po Saw had arrived, and were
urging the Kachin chief not to visit the British.</p>

<p>The right course was now clear. Adamson told the men
publicly to go back to Kansi Naung and tell him that if
he did not appear before ten o'clock next day the column
would advance to the jade-mines by force if necessary.
Later in the day the polyglot and polygamous interpreter,
Safdar Ali, volunteered to go to the Kachin camp to see if
he could influence the Kachins, or at any rate find out what
was in their minds. His offer was accepted. At the same
time all was made ready for a fight. Next day (February
9th) Safdar Ali returned with a message from Kansi Naung
that the Sawbwa would come, but that ten o'clock was too
early for him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>
<p>Captain Triscott fixed the advancing or attacking force at
one hundred rifles and one gun; the rest were not more than
sufficient to defend the camp. The numbers of possible
enemies might be large, and if the advance was opposed the
camp also would probably be assailed. By nine o'clock the
men had fallen in and were waiting for the order to march,
when a large party appeared on the opposite side of the
river. The leading man carried a fine pair of elephant
tusks. It was evidently a friendly visit, and proved to be
Kansi Naung with twelve other chiefs. The troops drawn
up for a hostile advance were at once turned into a guard
of honour. The military and civil leaders sat in chairs in
front of the hut in which they had sheltered, and the
Kachin Sawbwas on their arrival were seated on the ground
in front of them. The tusks were presented and all the
chiefs made their submission. Major Adamson assured
them, Shwè Gya interpreting, that the British Government
would respect their rights in the mines. They were warned
against listening to Po Saw, who had been dismissed from
the British service. Presents were given to each of them,
and they were dismissed.</p>

<p>On their departure the troops immediately fell in and
started for the jade-mines, which were reached after an uneventful
march on a rough forest path, which rose to an
altitude of fifteen hundred feet. There was not much to see.
"A collection of about fifty houses and what appeared to be
a large quarry, while all over the place were blocks of white
stone of all sizes, some of which were tinged or streaked
with green." The main object of the expedition, to obtain
the submission of the Kachin chiefs and assert the authority
of the Government and its right to the revenue from the
mines, had been attained. As no water was to be had,
and there were no rations for the men, the force, after a
short rest, marched back to camp. Everything had gone
well during their absence from the camp. But disquieting
letters had come from Mogaung, telling of a Kachin assault
on the stockade.</p>

<p>It remained now to explore the Indaw country. Taking
only a small party from the camp, Adamson went in boats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
up the Indaw River to the lake, a very fine piece of water,
about sixteen miles long from north to south by six broad.
He found the country round it to be naturally fertile and
bearing marks of much former prosperity. But it had been
the scene of the Kachin rebellion of 1883, which had its
rising here, and here also the rebels had made their last
stand. It had been devastated with all the ruthlessness
of an Asiatic conqueror. It bore the marks of recent prosperity
and a thick population. Good roads still united the
ruined villages; nearly every little stream was crossed by
solid teak bridges; sites of old villages still showed gardens
of mango, jack, tamarind, and other fruit trees growing
amongst monasteries and pagodas all absolutely deserted,
amidst great stretches of splendid rice plains showing signs
of recent cultivation. Yet only one small patch of land,
about ten acres under tillage, and only in a few places
some poor huts which, surrounded by double and treble
stockades, showed the conditions under which the few
surviving peasants lived.</p>

<p>It was hoped that with unlimited rice plains, a magnificent
lake swarming with fish, a Government that would
enforce peace, with open water communications and in
the near future a railroad, this beautiful country would
recover prosperity. All that can be said after a generation
has passed is that "it is only beginning to recover from
the devastation caused by the Kachin rising of 1883"
(<i>Burma Gazetteer</i>, vol ii., p. 120, edit. 1908). So much
easier is it to destroy than to restore.</p>

<p>The Indawgyi country being now explored, the party
rejoined the main body at the Sakaw camp, and the force
set out on its return march to Mogaung. They had left
Mogaung on the 27th of January, and had marched for
four weeks through jungles and marshes most favourable
to a savage enemy skilled in ambuscade. Yet not a shot
had been fired. Po Saw, however, had been busy with
the Kachins. Mogaung had been attacked on the 3rd of
February, and the report of this had reached Major
Adamson. They were prepared, therefore, for hostilities,
and before they reached Mogaung, on the 24th of February,
they were attacked and lost several men.</p>

<p>The state of affairs at Mogaung was not very reassuring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
The people were in much alarm. Women and children
were sleeping in the boats. The road was unsafe, and communication
with the Irrawaddy was interrupted. The last
boats, four in number, which left the town with the mails
and some prisoners under a guard, had been fired on by
Kachins; and a boatman and one of the Gurkha police
were hit. No Chinese boat had ventured up the river for
three weeks. The resident Chinese were putting their
temple in order of defence, and every one expected that
there would be fighting.</p>

<p>The expeditionary force had, however, to return to Bhamo.
They had accomplished the work for which they had been
detached. Major Adamson also was obliged to resume the
charge of his district, which had been left more or less
during his absence to a subordinate officer.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Mogaung,
the town and the subdivision, were placed in the hands
of Mr. Twomey, the Assistant Commissioner, supported by
Captain O'Donnell and the military police, who were quite
able to defend the stockade and the town, but were not
strong enough to keep the country around in order, if the
Kachins came down.</p>

<p>The arrangement was that Captain Triscott should
march back by the land route through Mohnyin to Katha
and open up the country which had not been explored.
It had been intended originally to send a small force up
from Katha to meet him. This proved impracticable, but
a party of military police had occupied Mohnyin. Accordingly
the expeditionary force marched back by this route.
They were opposed several times by bodies of Kachins, who
had fortified themselves in positions across the road. These
enemies, however, were easily dislodged by the guns, and
a junction with the military police was effected at Mohnyin.
The rest of the return march was made without incident.</p>

<p>It was hardly to be expected in any case that Major
Adamson's expedition should result in the immediate
establishment of peace in the Mogaung country and in
placing our relations with the Kachins on a friendly
footing. To secure the submission of a wild people divided
into as many tribes as there are hills in their country, and
to bring them under a civilized system of government, is
not the work of a few weeks. But it was hoped that more
than a beginning had been made, and that time and the
residence of British officers at Mogaung would do the
rest.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>
<p>Some untoward events had occurred to render this hope
vain. The conduct of Po Saw in leaving Mogaung and
taking refuge with the Kachins was the main cause of the
difficulties which began to be felt early in 1888. If Major
Adamson had been successful in capturing Po Saw when
he made Bo Ti a prisoner, and if Bo Ti had been securely
detained, much of the trouble which followed during the
subsequent years 1888 and 1889, and even later, would have
been avoided. Unfortunately the advantage accruing from
Bo Ti's capture was soon to be lost. He was sent down
to Bhamo and confined in the jail there. The jail, like
other buildings in Upper Burma, was made of wood. It
had a stout teak palisade round it, secure enough if the
guard had been trustworthy. It happened that just at
that time an attempt had been made to assassinate the
Colonel commanding in Bhamo. While he was dressing
for mess his body-servant crept up behind him as he stood
at the glass and stabbed him in the back. The servant,
a native of India, was arrested at once and locked up,
pending trial, in the same jail with Bo Ti. These two
conspired to escape. They scooped away the ground from
the base of some of the big teak posts which formed the
palisade and contrived to loosen them. The guard being
either asleep or in collusion with them, they got away.</p>

<p>Bo Ti soon made his escape felt by our people at
Mogaung. He joined Po Saw somewhere in the Kachin
Hills, probably at Thama, and helped to raise the tribes.
The influence of both these men over the Kachins was
very great. In Po Saw's case it was probably more hereditary
than personal. He was descended from the former
ruling family, and with the Kachins as well as with the
Burmans a drop of royal blood counts for much. Personally
Po Saw seems to have been a treacherous and
cowardly character. Bo Ti, on the contrary, was a bold
leader and had some military capacity. The two together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
were powerful for mischief; and it would have saved much
hard work to our men and many lives if they had been
shot in the beginning. However, there they were, and they
had to be reckoned with. The assault on Mogaung and
the attack on the column returning from the jade-mines
(<i>vide</i> p. 256) were, in fact, the work of Po Saw.</p>

<p>For a short time after Major Adamson left with the
expeditionary force there were no disturbances. But signs
and rumours of Po Saw's activity were frequent. The
attempts to stop the column on its way from Mogaung to
Mohnyin were organized or instigated by him. In the
latter half of April the rumours began to take shape, and
the Kachins were said to be on the warpath. In the
third week of April the headman of a group of villages
in the rice plain south of Mogaung reported to the Assistant
Commissioner that Bo Ti and three chiefs of the Ithi
Kachin tribe had ordered him to join a party which they
were organizing for an assault on Mogaung. If he refused,
they threatened to destroy the village of Taungbaw in
which he lived. They required him to meet them at a
given place to settle details. At this time Mr. Twomey,
owing to an accidental wound, had taken leave, and
Lieutenant L. E. Eliott, a young soldier who had been
appointed to the Commission, held his place. The
headman proposed that a strong party should be sent
from Mogaung to ambush Bo Ti and his friends when
they came to the trysting-place. This proposal seemed
to Lieutenant Eliott to be treacherous dealing which
a British officer ought not to countenance, and he refused
to join in it; a piece of high-minded chivalry somewhat
misplaced under the circumstances. The headman
having been advised by Lieutenant Eliott not to keep the
appointment with Bo Ti lest treachery should be intended,
left the fort.</p>

<p>Early next morning he ran in to report that before dawn
Bo Ti, with some hundreds of men, had come to Taungbaw
and were stockading themselves in the village. Taungbaw
is four or five miles from Mogaung. Captain O'Donnell and
Lieutenant Eliott, taking the mounted men and a company
of Gurkhas, started at once for the scene of action, ordering
reinforcements to follow. They met fugitives who confirmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the headman's report, and said that Bo Ti was in
strong force and was fortifying his position. Taungbaw is
on a small hill rising abruptly from the plain, detached and
about 400 yards distant from the main ridge, and about
the same distance from a village called Zédi, which was
occupied by friendlies, Burmese and Shan peasants, from
the plain. Bo Ti had been too busy in strengthening his
position to pay attention to the movements of these people.</p>

<p>When O'Donnell and his men were about six thousand
paces from the hill, a signal shot was fired by the enemy's
outpost. Advancing to within 400 yards, our men delivered
several volleys. Each volley was answered by a Kachin
cheer. Evidently they meant to make a stand. At this
moment the reinforcements from Mogaung came up and
it was decided to attack the Kachin position. The hill was
steep and covered with thick bamboo jungle, very difficult to
get through. The enemy could not be seen. Dividing his
men into three parties, O'Donnell sent the mounted men
round the left flank to form up in rear of the hills. Part
of his infantry were sent round the right flank and told to
get well under the hill. The remainder, led by the two
British officers, then worked round the right flank, which
seemed to offer the best openings for an ascent. As they
crossed a narrow causeway in a paddy-field and a small
bridge they drew the Kachin fire.</p>

<p>On coming into touch with the first party it was told to
go farther on round the hill. The order was then given to
advance with fixed bayonets. The bamboo jungle prevented
the men from getting on fast. A heavy fire was kept up
by the Kachins, but owing to the steepness of the ascent
the bullets flew high and there were no casualties. Beyond
the bamboo jungle was the village stockade, which was
within 30 yards of Bo Ti's position. But when the Kachins
saw the Gurkhas forcing their way through this stockade,
they did not wait for the bayonet, but after firing a few
shots bolted down the hill, our men chasing them.</p>

<p>At the bottom the mounted men took up the running,
and it was a case of every man for himself, Unfortunately
when the firing began some of the Mounted Infantry ponies
were scared and broke away. Owing to this mischance the
pursuit was less effective than it should have been. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
so the affair was well managed and gave a lesson to the
Kachins, who left eighteen dead near the village and on
the line of flight, and several prisoners were also taken.
The friendly villagers lay low during the fight. When it
was all over they came to the front and began mutilating
the dead in a barbarous fashion, and were driven off with
difficulty and not without force.</p>

<p>Some anxiety was felt by Captain O'Donnell and Mr.
Eliott lest Po Saw, learning that the greater part of the
garrison had gone out, should attack the Mogaung stockade.
Only sixty-six men, some of them sick, had been left in the
fort&mdash;enough, perhaps, to hold it, but not to defend the town.
Fortunately no attempt was made by Po Saw. At the time
of the fight he was on his way to the jade-mines. He had
attempted, as it was learnt afterwards, to come to Bo Ti's
assistance, but he could not reach the scene of the fight in
time.</p>

<p>The next month showed constant activity on the part
of Po Saw and Bo Ti and their Kachin allies. Frequent
attacks were made on boats going down or up the Mogaung
River. It became necessary to send them in convoys with
police guards. Villages near Mogaung were raided, and
early in May Nanpapa, near Sinbo, was attacked, many
villagers killed or carried away, and the village destroyed.
Po Saw himself took up a position at Kamaing, where he
could harass the traders on the route to the jade-mines
and Indawgyi, and from which he could also threaten
Mogaung. It was not possible for Captain O'Donnell to
drive him away or to act on the offensive at any distance
from the fort. Hence the enemy became more
daring.</p>

<p>On the 21st of May, under cover of night, a large body
of Shans, under Bo Ti, got into the town and took up
positions within the low brick-wall enclosures of the
pagodas, which, as has been described, were scattered about
in and outside the town. The garrison, under Captain
O'Donnell and Lieutenant Eliott, turned out against them.
A really good fight followed, in which the enemy lost forty-nine
men killed and many wounded, and were driven in
confusion out of the town. They were nearly all Shans,
some of whom had come from the Uyu country beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the jade-mines. The garrison lost twenty-three men killed
and wounded. The Gurkhas were gallantly led, and behaved
grandly, and on that day the Mogaung Levy won a name
for itself.</p>

<p>The situation at Mogaung caused some anxiety. The
garrison was too weak. Its strength was now only two
hundred and ninety-two men, many of whom were sick, not
enough to allow a force to leave the post for a day. Two
hundred men were ordered up from Bhamo, and with that
addition the garrison would be able to hold their own, but
it would not suffice to enable them to punish the Kachins.
Bo Ti was occupying a place called Nyaungbintha, in the
midst of the Ithi tribe of Kachins, by whom he was strongly
backed. At Kamaing on the north was Po Saw, supported
by the Thama Sawbwa of the Lepei tribe, who appeared to
be most hostile. There could be no permanent peace until
the strength of these tribes should be broken.</p>

<p>At the earnest request of the Chief Commissioner two
mountain-guns, with the necessary equipment, were given
to the Mogaung Levy. There was some not unnatural
reluctance on the part of the military authorities in India
to trust an irregular force with artillery. But the excellent
conduct of the men in the late fights, and the proved
capacity of the gallant young soldier commanding them,
overcame their unwillingness. It was impossible to allow
Captain O'Donnell to attack stockades and to turn large
bodies of the enemy out of strong positions without
artillery. With only one British officer, or at the most
two, a chance shot or a bamboo spike might deprive the
force of its commander and cause a disaster. The Chief
Commissioner pressed this argument, and asked to be
allowed to raise the garrison of Mogaung to ten companies.
Sanction was given in October.</p>

<p>It took time, however, to raise and train the additional
companies of Gurkhas; and in any case the expeditions
which the conduct of the Kachins had rendered necessary
could not have been undertaken until the rains had passed.
In the meanwhile, until the guns and reinforcements reached
them, the Mogaung officers were instructed to concentrate
their men in Mogaung, not to attempt to occupy outposts;
to move about patrols of fifty men when the weather permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
it; to strike at the enemy when they saw a good
opening and could inflict real punishment; while leaving
always enough men in the fort to defend it and the town.
They were forbidden to make small and hasty expeditions
into the Kachin Hills in order to retaliate on raiders. These
restrictions were galling, no doubt, to Captain O'Donnell and
to the Assistant Commissioner, Lieutenant L. E. Eliott,
who was a keen soldier as well as a promising administrator.
The Chief Commissioner, however, could not risk
a catastrophe. Moreover, he held that spasmodic action
of this sort, while exposing small parties of our men to
much risk, only embittered the wild hill-men without
impressing them with our strength, and was transient in
its effects. The plan of subsidizing those chiefs who were
not in arms against us, and could help to guard the trade
routes or carry the mails, was recommended.</p>

<p>Present needs having been provided for, a plan of operations
to be undertaken during the coming open season was
framed by the Chief Commissioner, in consultation with
Sir George White, and early in November it was sanctioned
by the Government of India. Four separate operations
were to be undertaken.</p>

<p>1. Against the Lepei tribe north of Mogaung, the leading
chief being the Sawbwa of Thama, Po Saw's main
supporter.</p>

<p>2. Against the Ithi tribe south of Mogaung, who were
under the Sawbwa of Panga.</p>

<p>3. Against the Sana Kachins of the Lataung tribe, who
had raided near Mogaung in May.</p>

<p>4. Against the Makau and other tribes in the neighbourhood
of Sinbo, who were responsible for the
destructive attack on Nanpapa in May, and for another in
August on trading boats at Hlegyomaw on the Mogaung
River.</p>

<p>The control of these operations was taken by Sir George
White at the Chief Commissioner's request, the military
police in the subdivision being placed at his disposal.
While the necessary preparations were being made, letters
of the nature of an ultimatum were sent to the Sawbwas
of Thama and Panga and other tribal chiefs, requiring them
to make formal submission to the subdivisional officer at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Mogaung, to pay for the damage done by them to traders,
and to surrender Po Saw and Bo Ti, who had lately
added to their crimes the murders of Shwè Gya, the best
friend the British Administration had in Mogaung, and
of the loyal headman of Kamaing who had always
helped us.</p>

<p>On the 7th of January, 1889, the force<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> detailed for these
expeditions left Mogaung under command of Captain
O'Donnell.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The first step was to occupy Kamaing, after
a very slight opposition by the Thama Sawbwa's men,
and to establish a permanent military police post there.
Unfortunately smallpox broke out amongst the Gurkhas
of the Levy, and Captain O'Donnell found it necessary to
halt at Kamaing until the 15th of February, and thus a
whole month of the most favourable season for military
operations was lost.</p>

<p>On the 15th of February, the men's health having been
restored, the force fell to work with energy, and engagement
rapidly followed engagement. On the 16th of February
three villages were taken after some resistance. On the
17th the Kachins were encountered on a strongly stockaded
position, which was taken and destroyed. On the 19th
Thama itself was taken. The enemy here showed more
fight. Three men of the Hampshires received gunshot
wounds, and two officers and eleven men were injured by
bamboo spikes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain O'Donnell's report gives the following account
of this engagement, which shows the nature of the
fighting in these expeditions:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My guide, who had done splendidly up to this, lost
me four valuable hours in finding the road. He struck
it at last, and after a severe climb of 4&frac12; miles, we came
out near the village of Thama. On arriving at the crest
of the hill Lieutenant Eliott, Assistant Commissioner,
received a letter, stuck in a stick on the road, from Thama
Sawbwa, in which he said we might come and burn his
village, he would do nothing but hide in the jungle, &amp;c.
This put us on our guard, and we went on cautiously
over the crest, and then saw what appeared to me through
my glasses, a garden paling. I examined it well, but found
nothing suspicious about it. However, I ordered the
advance with all caution. The Hants were in front, the
Gurkhas forming flanking parties in rear. When about
sixty yards from the place we could not make out that
it was more than a paling, when suddenly we were saluted
by a volley from many guns. Three Hants men fell under
this badly wounded, but the remainder walked off the road
into the jungle and poured in some very steady volleys.
The Gurkhas were quickly up on the right flank, and the
guns were brought up and two rounds fired at the stockade,
and then with a wild cheer it was rushed and taken, the
rebels not waiting....</p>

<p>"Blood was found here. I went on, leaving the rear-guard
to bring on the wounded. We came before a second
stockade; we were again saluted, but no casualties occurred,
and one round from a gun and another charge made us
masters of this also. In this charge much damage was
done us, two officers and eleven rank-and-file being spiked
by bamboo spikes. Captain Macdonald and I were both
spiked through the foot. After this no more opposition
was met with and Thama was entered and destroyed.
A search in the jungle was made, but nothing found. After
the sick had been attended to I returned to camp, meeting
no opposition <i>en route</i>."</p>

<p>On the 21st of February a place called Muklon was
assaulted and taken. Here Lieutenant Hawker, of the
Hampshire Regiment, fell badly wounded&mdash;spiked in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
thigh. He was sent down to Bhamo, where he died of
the wound. By the 9th of March the operations against
the Lepei tribe had been completed, all their villages or
stockades taken, and large quantities of grain captured. Our
losses amounted to twenty-one officers and men killed and
wounded. The Kachin loss is not known; it was probably
very small, as they made no firm stand.</p>

<p>After little more than a day's rest Captain O'Donnell
moved out again, this time against the Ithi tribe to the
south of Mogaung. He established a post at Nyaungbintha,
in the centre of their territory. By the 28th of March
ten villages of this tribe had been taken with very little
fighting. The village of Waranaung, of which the chief
had been loyal in every respect since the occupation of
Mogaung, was carefully preserved from injury.</p>

<p>On the 4th of April a move was made against Sana,
which fell without an effort.</p>

<p>The column now turned south to Sinbo, and from that
base moved out to punish the villages concerned in the
barbarous raids on Nanpapa and Hlegyomaw. The villages
concerned having been taken after some resistance, the
task assigned to Captain O'Donnell was completed on the
4th of May.</p>

<p>In these four expeditions our casualties amounted to one
officer and three men killed, and five officers and thirty
men (including followers) wounded. The column was
engaged with Kachins thirty-two times, and took forty-six
stockades. Owing to the loss of a month by the sickness
at Kamaing, the work was more hurried than the Chief
Commissioner had designed. The results, however, were
very good, and had been obtained with more ease and less
bloodshed than had been expected. By the occupation
of Kamaing, the trade route to the jade-mines was opened
and made safe. The Marip tribe who dominate the jade-mines,
and the Sassum tribe who adjoin the amber-mines,
were freed from Po Saw's pressure and their loyalty assured.
Villages from the Kachin tribes came in by scores to
make formal submission to the Assistant Commissioner at
Mogaung. Of the Thama Sawbwa's villages only Thama
and two others held out; the Ithi tribe, the Kachins round
Sinbo, and the Lakun tribe south of the Ithi country all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
submitted. In short, the peace of the district was secured
and the authority of the Government established.</p>

<p>From the number of casualties it might be inferred that
the service was one of little danger. The inference would
be wholly wrong. The column was engaged in bush or
jungle fighting with the enemy almost every day, and if our
casualties were not greater it was due as well to the precautions
taken by the leader and to his skilful tactics as to
the failure of the Kachins to defend their stockades. The
heaviest part of the work fell on the Gurkhas of the
Mogaung Levy (military police), who furnished the flanking
parties. Without them the force must have lost heavily.
"The flanking done by the Gurkhas was splendid indeed, and
it is entirely owing to their jungle work that I had not
more casualties."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The column marched over six hundred
and fifty miles, fighting continually, and the men's clothes
and boots were torn to pieces. It was a fine display of
patient endurance, courage, and persistence, in face of great
difficulties, by officers and men. The Commander, Captain
O'Donnell, was one of the soldiers to whom the Administration
of Burma in those days owed so much. And he was
greatly assisted by Lieutenant L. E. Eliott, to whom fell
the difficult duty of providing good guides and correct
information.</p>

<p>Captain O'Donnell concluded his report on the results
of the operations with a notice of Lieutenant W. Hawker,
of the Hants Regiment. "He was spiked through the thigh
while gallantly leading his men in a charge at Mukton on
the 15th of March, 1889. He was attached to the Mogaung
Levy for these operations. He was senior to Lieutenant
Benson, and might have taken command of the levy from
that officer." But he showed "a sincere spirit in the welfare
of the service" in refusing to supersede Lieutenant Benson,
who belonged to the Indian Army and knew the men and
their language. "He volunteered to take charge of the
transport on the line of march, and this he did until Captain
Macdonald was wounded. He was commanding the Hants
men when he received his death-wound."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

BHAMO, THE SOUTHERN TOWNSHIPS, AND MÖNG MIT</h2>


<p>South of Bhamo when we took the country was a Shan
State known as Möng Leng, and adjacent to it and
separating it from the district of the Ruby Mines was
another Shan State named Möng Mit. The two together
covered a large area, including the lower valley of the Shwèli
and stretching from the southern boundary of Bhamo to
the northern and north-western limits of the Northern
Shan States of Tawngpeng and North Hsenwi. Neither
of them was included in the list of Shan States proper.
They were much mixed up with the adjacent British districts
Bhamo Katha and the Ruby Mines. They were little
interested in the politics of the Shan States; and being
more easily accessible to the Burmese and very open to
Kachin raids, they had not much cohesion or independence.
For these reasons they were not placed under the jurisdiction
of the Superintendent of the Northern Shan States,
but were dealt with by the Commissioner of the Northern
Division.</p>

<p>At the time of the annexation the Sawbwa of Möng Mit
had died. His heir, a minor, was under the tutelage of the
<i>Amats</i>, or ministers, who formed a council to rule the State;
which, as well as its neighbour, Möng Leng, was in great
disorder. The diverse races which people this country,
Kachins and Palaungs<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> in the hills, Burmans and Shans
in the more open parts, make it hard to govern. In Möng
Leng there was in 1886-7 no central authority. In Möng
Mit the administration was very feeble. The Kachins were
in the ascendancy. They were ousting the Palaungs, and
trampled on the more peaceful villagers of the plains. But
even the Kachins had no cohesion and obeyed no central
authority. Each chief did what seemed best in his own
eyes; he raided and blackmailed every village that lay
within reach of his hills. The formation of the country,
a jumble of hills covered with dense jungle, through which
the drainage of the higher ranges forces its way naturally,
produced an unruly race. The only open tract of any
extent is the valley of the Lower Shwèli from Myitson
to the Irrawaddy at Pyinlebin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>
<p>Early in 1886 one Hkam Leng came to the Deputy Commissioner
of the Bhamo district which touches Möng
Leng on the south, and claimed to be recognized as the
chief of both Möng Leng and Möng Mit. He was told
that his claim would be inquired into, and that meanwhile
he should remain quietly in Katha. Towards the end of
the year, however, growing impatient, he went to Möng Mit
and presented himself to the people as their Sawbwa. But
they rejected him without ceremony. He applied to the
Deputy Commissioner for assistance without success, and
then became irreconcilable and a centre of disturbance.</p>

<p>The ministers of Möng Mit, on the other hand, were
loyal and helpful. To the extent of their power&mdash;not much,
it is true&mdash;they gave active assistance to the British force
which occupied the Ruby Mines in 1886-7. In April,
1887, the Chief Commissioner being at Mogok, the headquarters
of the Ruby Mines district, received the ministers
of Möng Mit there and inquired into the facts. Finding
that the title of the young Sawbwa was good, he confirmed
him in his position. It was decided to appoint a regent,
assisted by the ministers, to govern the State until the
young chief should come of age. The boundaries of
Möng Mit territory were defined, and Hkam Leng was
formally warned against overstepping them, while at the
same time he was assured that if he came in and made
submission to the Government he should be recognized
as chief of Möng Leng. In despite of this he attacked
villages in Möng Mit and endeavoured to establish
himself by force of arms.</p>

<p>During 1887 he continued in open hostility. Several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
small expeditions had to be made against him; and the
southern border of the Bhamo district, as well as the
Möng Leng country and the Kachins in all the hills
about, were kept in a restless state. As it was found
impossible to reconcile him, Hkam Leng was outlawed
and the Möng Leng country partitioned. The northern
part was added to the Bhamo district as the Upper
Sinkan township; the remainder was made over to Möng
Mit, to which it had at one time been subject.</p>

<p>Hkam Leng, however, was by no means disposed of.
He lurked for the most part in the Kachin Hills to the
east of the Möng Leng country, and was frequently
in the villages along the upper reaches of the Sinkan. To
him another restless spirit was soon allied. In 1886 the
two sons of the Hmethaya Prince, one of King Mindon's
numerous progeny, had made themselves prominent in
resisting the British Government. Their cause was taken
up by a notable guerilla leader, Shwè Yan, who raised
their standard in the Ava district. Driven out of Ava
at the end of 1886, they took hiding in Mandalay, where
a plot was hatched for supporting their claims. The
conspiracy was discovered and the leaders arrested. The
younger Prince was captured and sent to school in
Rangoon. The elder, Saw Yan Naing, escaped to Hsenwi,
and failing to get help there retired to the mountainous
and very difficult country on the borders of Tawnpeng and
Möng Mit. There he made his quarters in a strong
position not easy to approach, and gathered round him
a band of discontented and desperate characters. No
attempt was made during 1887-8 to dislodge him, and he
contented himself with threatening Möng Mit. He was
invited to surrender, and favourable terms were offered
to him. The only wish was to relieve the country from
his presence. But he would have no truck with us.</p>

<p>Early in 1889 reports came in from Bhamo and other
sources that Saw Yan Naing and Hkam Leng had agreed
to unite forces and make simultaneous attacks on various
points in the north. They were reported to be enlisting
the aid of Kachin tribesmen, Chinese bandits from across
the border, and Burmese outlaws. Risings were to be
organized in the Upper Sinkan township and a descent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
made on Möng Mit. Even the date for the rising was
fixed. Whether there was any systematic concert or not
was never ascertained, but a good many outbreaks
occurred without any visible connection and of no great
magnitude, but enough, taken all together, to harass
both soldiers and police, as well as those responsible for
the administration. From the Ruby Mines district
as early as the last week in December had come reports
of a gathering, headed by Saw Yan Naing, at Manpun, in the
hills, three marches from the town of Möng Mit. A
detachment from the Hampshire Regiment was sent from
Bernard Myo, the Cantonment of the Ruby Mines, to Möng
Mit, to garrison the town, while the State levies went
out to act against the body of rebels at Manpun.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lieutenant Nugent, who was in command
at Möng Mit, hearing that there were some dacoits a few
miles off, went with sixteen men of the Hampshires to
attack them. The dacoits were strongly posted. Lieutenant
Nugent and one private were killed and six men wounded.
The remaining nine men, encumbered with the wounded,
had to retire. This disaster happened on the 14th of
January. Lieutenant Nugent was a young officer without
experience of the country, and he ought not to have
been left without some one capable of advising him.</p>

<p>It was promptly retrieved. The Deputy Commissioner, Mr.
Archibald Colquhoun, getting together troops and police,
renewed the attack on the enemy's position and drove
them out with much loss. On the 20th of January the
village or town of Twingé, on the Irrawaddy, was taken
and burnt by one of Hkam Leng's adherents. No attempt
was made on Möng Mit after that date, and no formidable
bands were encountered, although the Ruby Mines districts
and the adjacent parts of Möng Mit were harassed by
small gangs of robbers. A feeling of anxiety, however,
prevailed and begat alarming rumours. The imagination
of Shans, Burmans, and perhaps of other nervous persons,
is fertile in the matter of numbers, and loves to deal in
large figures. At the end of January hostile gatherings at
different points, amounting to nearly two thousand men&mdash;a
quite impossible number&mdash;were reported from Mogok, the
headquarters of the Ruby Mines district. With a view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
to allaying these apprehensions the garrisons there and
at Möng Mit were strengthened.</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner thought it best, under the
circumstances, to place the control in the hands of one man,
and at his request Sir George White appointed Colonel
Cockran, of the Hampshires, to command all the troops
and military police in the disturbed area, with orders
to take the measures necessary for the peace of the
country and for the destruction of such gangs as might
be found. Up to the end of March, however, no important
action was taken, as no large body of the enemy had been
located.</p>

<p>On the 30th of March a column under Major Garfit,
of the Hampshire Regiment, was dispatched against Saw
Yan Naing, who was still at Binbong, near Manpun.
Four stockades were taken without loss on our side,
and Saw Yan Naing and his following fell back for
the time. The Chief Commissioner intended, and had
arranged with the Major-General commanding, that this
column should remain in Binbong and the neighbourhood
at least till the middle of April, in order to make our
influence felt in these wild parts and to co-operate with a
police force which had been sent through Mönglong, a
sub-State of Hsipaw, lying south-west of Möng Mit, and also
to join hands with Lieutenant Daly, the Superintendent
of the Northern Shan States, who was ordered to come
with military police through Tawnpeng. Unfortunately
the officer commanding misunderstood his instructions,
and leaving Binbong on the 6th of April returned to Möng
Mit. The expedition consequently was not very fruitful
of results, and Saw Yan Naing returned to the neighbourhood
and took up his quarters at Manton a little
farther north.</p>

<p>Unluckily, Lieutenant Daly was unable to leave his headquarters
at Lashio until the 7th of April. He then proceeded
to Tawnpeng in accordance with the orders he had
received from the Chief Commissioner, directing him to
co-operate if possible with the force acting against Saw Yan
Naing. Lieutenant Daly had been instructed also to
get into communication with the Prince, and to renew the
offer of terms if he would surrender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>In January, when at Hsipaw, Lieutenant Daly had met
a Shan who had been with Saw Yan Naing in July and
August of the year preceding (1888); this man undertook
to take letters to the pretender. He arrived at Möng Mit
soon after the defeat of the band which had gathered near
that place, and heard that the Prince had left Manpun after
that encounter, in which one of his chief followers, besides
many others, had fallen. The messenger, therefore, was
unable to deliver the letters. However, in March Lieutenant
Daly, being at Hsipaw, again met this man, and
sent him off with fresh letters to the Prince. Again
fortune was adverse. Major Garfit delivered his attack just
before Lieutenant Daly's man reached Manpun, and the
Prince had gone. However, he had not gone far, and was
found by the messenger in Möng Mit territory, in a Palaung
village. He had a following of one hundred men, more
or less, of whom twenty were Burmans, the rest Shans
and Kachins; none of them men of note. As Saw Yan
Naing had been attacked only two or three days before
by the column from Möng Mit, he was not disposed to
trust the promises made to induce his surrender. Nevertheless,
he behaved as a Prince should. The messengers
were allowed to stay four days in his camp, and were
hospitably treated.</p>

<p>They were then dismissed with a polite letter, to the
effect that "he had not plotted against the Government,
but that on account of his past offences he feared to
come in, that he had no wish for Government alms" (an
allowance had been offered to him); "and that he would
take to flight if Lieutenant Daly came near his camp."
He had married the daughter of a Kachin chief. It may
be that beyond allowing himself to be made the centre of
disturbance he had taken no active part in the movements
made in his name. None the less his presence in British
territory was the cause of trouble.</p>

<p>While these events were passing in Möng Mit a watchful
eye had to be kept on other parts of the district. Towards
the end of December, 1888, the Deputy Commissioner of
Bhamo received news of the appearance of a Mintha,
or prince of some kind, on the Molè River, north-east
of Bhamo. This Prince gave out that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
in concert with Saw Yan Naing, and his plans may
have been conceived with the design of acting with
Saw Yan Naing and Hkam Leng. The rising appeared
to be somewhat formidable. It was promptly met. Mr.
Segrave, the Superintendent of Police, was sent out at
once with a strong detachment of military police. He
encountered the band, which was made up mainly of
Chinese brigands and deserters from the Chinese army,
on the 9th of January, 1889, and punished it severely, killing
more than fifty men. The rest dispersed and escaped,
probably over the Chinese border. The peace of the district
north of Bhamo was not disturbed again during the year.
The connection of this band with Saw Yan Naing was not
established. In their camp were found papers showing
that they were in communication with the leaders of the
Mogaung malcontents, namely, the Sawbwa of Thama and
Po Saw.</p>

<p>Hitherto it had been found impossible to post military
police in the Upper Sinkan township. The difficulty of communication,
especially in the rains, was great, and the
climate very hurtful. The best possible arrangement was
made by appointing a Kachin of much influence to act as
magistrate and executive officer, and this man had been
able to keep order, at least on the surface. His headquarters
were at Sikaw. In December, 1888, Mr. Shaw,
the Deputy Commissioner, visited Sikaw and also Si-u, an
important village near the head of the Sinkan stream. He
learnt that Hkam Leng, who was allied by marriage to the
Kachin chiefs of the Lweseng and Tonhon range in the
east of the township, was harboured by them, and from
time to time came down to Si-u and levied contributions
from the peasants. The Kachin magistrate had followed
the Burman plan of shutting his eyes to that which it was
inconvenient to see, and, lest he should incur his superior's
displeasure, he said nothing about it. He was warned
against permitting Hkam Leng to enter his township, and
ordered to send speedy information to Bhamo if he should
reappear. This warning had a good effect. Early in January,
1889, he reported that Hkam Leng had returned to Si-u, and
was corresponding with a pretended Prince at Hpon Kan,
a hill range thirty miles from Bhamo, a very nest of hornets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
At the same time information was received from other
sources that a large gathering of Chinese and Burmese,
said to number five hundred men, were at Hpon
Kan.</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner was at Bhamo at the end of
January. He arranged that a patrol of troops should visit
Sikaw and Si-u at least once a month. Unfortunately
something prevented the despatch of the military patrol,
and on the 3rd of February the duty was entrusted to a
party of fifty military police. On the 4th of February, at
Malin, a village on the Sinkan River, about twenty miles
from Si-u, the police came on a large body of rebels
strongly stockaded. They attacked the stockade, but were
repulsed, losing two men killed and ten wounded and all
their baggage.</p>

<p>A strong column, consisting of 60 rifles of the Hampshire
Regiment, 150 of the 17th Bengal Infantry, and two guns,
left Bhamo as soon as news of this disaster came in. On the
7th of February, after driving in their outposts, this force
engaged the enemy at Malin, where they were holding a
strong position. They stood their ground with more than
usual courage, and were not dislodged without some severe
fighting, which cost us the loss of one officer and four men
killed and eighteen wounded. The pursuit was carried for
some distance, but they did not rally, and dispersed over
the country. It was ascertained that this rising had been
organized by Hkam Leng and Saw Yan Naing. In fact, the
nucleus of the gang was a body of eighty or ninety men
from the Prince's headquarters at Manpun joined by large
numbers of villagers, some of their own free will, some
under compulsion. The villages that furnished contingents
were fined, the police force increased at the cost of the
township, and the population as far as possible disarmed.
No attempt was made to punish the individuals who had
taken part in the business. Hkam Leng retired to his
Kachin wife and allies in the hills.</p>

<p>Late in May an attempt was made to capture him, but
it was frustrated by his Kachin supporters, who afterwards
came down in force and occupied Si-u. On the 2nd of June
they were attacked by troops and police and driven out,
losing twenty-one killed. The police force in the Upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Sinkan was reinforced again. The rains being now at hand,
further action had to be postponed.</p>

<p>Everything united to obstruct the work of bringing this
part of the country into order. The hills and forests, the
neighbourhood of the Chinese frontier, the character of
the people, Kachins and Palaungs, who had to be dealt with
piecemeal hill by hill, and had never submitted to any
central control, all combined to make it a very hard task.
The Burmese officials may have had some control over the
tribes. But probably so long as they did not make too
much disturbance the hill-men were left to do as they liked.
When there is no government things arrange themselves,
and a limit is automatically fixed which the raiding tribes
cannot exceed without exhausting their preserves. The
advent of the British cut the weak bonds by which the hill
people had been held, and the appearance of Saw Yan Naing
and Hkam Leng as active opponents of the foreign invaders
gave them a rallying-point.</p>

<p>The first step towards peace was the capture or expulsion
of these two leaders, both of whom, it may be noted, following
the example of more enlightened princes, had cemented
their alliances by marriage with Kachin ladies of rank.
It was decided, therefore, so far as the northern part of the
province was concerned, to devote the open season of 1889-90
to the complete subjugation of this tract of country. If
possible, the two leaders were to be got rid of. In any
case the recalcitrant Kachins and others were to be reduced
to obedience and the authority of the Möng Mit State
over its outlying parts affirmed. In the district north of
Bhamo nothing called for immediate action. A strong body
of seasoned Gurkhas from the Mogaung Levy under Captain
O'Donnell could be detached to strengthen the column of
troops provided from the Bhamo garrison.</p>

<p>It was arranged accordingly that one column should go
to Si-u and move early in December against the Lwèseng
and Ton Hon Kachins and then move on to Manpun; and
that a second, starting from Möng Mit, should join the first
at Manpun, while at the same time the Superintendent
of the Northern Shan States (Lieutenant Hugh Daly)
should move with some of the Shan Levy (Indian military
police) through Hsenwi and act with the first two columns;
and a fourth column, also of military police under Mr.
H. F. Hertz, Assistant Superintendent of Police, should work
up from the south-east through Möng Löng and along the
Tawnpeng Möng Mit boundary.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bargaining with Haka Chins.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>
<p>Instructions were given to the Sawbwas of Tawnpeng
and North Hsenwi to take measures to stop the passage
of fugitives through their States. There was a reasonable
hope that these measures, although they might not effect
the capture of the leaders, would establish the authority
of the British Government and bring home to the people
of this difficult tract the inconvenience of resistance.</p>

<p>The Bhamo column, commanded by Major Blundell,
accompanied by Mr. G. W. Shaw, the Deputy Commissioner,
left Bhamo on the 15th of December, 1889, for
Sikaw. The tribes began to take in the situation. Twelve
hills or groups of the Lakun tribe came to Sikaw to make
formal submission, and one of their leading men volunteered
to guide the force against Lwèseng. This was a good
beginning. Major Blundell, sending forward a detachment
to Si-u to keep the road open, left Sikaw on the 20th
of December and marched on Lwèseng. A party of
Gurkhas under Captain O'Donnell was ordered to take
up a position at the ferries in the rear of the Lwèseng
Range, which were said to be the only places where the
Shwèli River could be crossed. Several other such points,
however, were found, and at one of them were signs that
the fugitives had already crossed over. While making
this reconnaissance Captain O'Donnell's men were exposed
to Kachin fire from the hills, and a very distinguished
Gurkha officer (Kala Thapa Sing) fell.</p>

<p>The main body reached Lwèseng on the 22nd of December.
A stockade across the road a mile from the village
was defended by Kachins, and in taking it a native officer
was killed and five men wounded. The village was found
deserted, and was occupied by our men. There was some
sniping from the hill-slope afterwards, and two were
wounded. Next day the force advanced to Ton Hon.
Two stockades erected across the road were defended, but
were turned, with the loss of two men wounded, and Ton
Hon was occupied without further fighting. But again
the Kachins fired from the hills into the village, and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Gurkha was killed and another wounded. A halt was
made at Ton Hon for some days in order to open communications
with the Kachins, in the hope of bringing them
to terms. The elders of Lwèseng and Ton Hon and
other neighbouring villages came in. The Deputy Commissioner
selected seven villages which had opposed the
troops and harboured rebels, and imposed on them a fine
of money (Rs. 2,500) and guns (50). By the 30th of
December all the villages belonging to these tribes had
submitted and part of the fine had been paid. The chiefs,
however, still held aloof.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of January, 1890, the column left for Manton,
leaving a Burmese civil officer, supported by a detachment
of the 17th Bengal Infantry, to collect the balance of the
fine. Manton was reached without any fighting on the
11th of January; and the column from Möng Mit marched
in on the same day. The village was found deserted, and
Saw Yan Naing had fled. He made his escape, it was said,
into the Chinese territory of Chefan. On his road through
Northern Hsenwi he just missed falling into the hands
of Mr. Daly, who arrived at Manton on the 16th of January.
Thus the three parties met and were able to exchange
information. After a few days' halt Mr. Daly continued
his tour through Hsenwi territory, while the Möng Mit
and Bhamo columns waited at Manton for supplies. Some
villages which had been hostile were visited; and as a
large body of Kachins and Palaungs was reported to have
gathered at Lanchein, a few miles south of Manton, where
Saw Yan Naing had stayed on his flight, two detachments
were sent out to disperse them. Stockades had been built
across the road and were stubbornly defended by the enemy.
Here Major Forrest, in leading one of the detachments, was
severely wounded. The village was taken and destroyed,
while the troops returned to Manton.</p>

<p>It was now decided that the Möng Mit party under
Major Greenaway, with Mr. Daniell as civil officer, should
move south to Manpun, while the Bhamo column remained
at Manton. On the way Mr. Daniell was met by the
headmen of the villages between Manton and Manpun who
had come to tender their submission to the British Government.
They were told that if Saw Yan Naing was with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
them he must be given up, and fines were imposed on those groups
or circles of villages which were known to have
given the rebel leaders active help.</p>

<p>By the 25th of January all the headmen of the five hills
or circles comprised in the south-western quarter of the
Möng Mit State had made formal submission. On the
26th of January Mr. Hertz, who had marched from the
south-east through Möng Löng with his military police,
arrived in Manton. The rough country along the Taungbaing
border had been entrusted to him to search&mdash;a duty
he performed well, while as a by-work he constructed a very
useful map of the ground. The Möng Mit column moved
to Yabon, a village nearer to Möng Mit, and from its position
a better base for operations. News was now received
that Hkam Leng was in hiding in Sumput, a village north
of the Shwèli. Major Greenaway, accompanied by Mr.
Shaw, marched with a part of his force for Sumput by way
of Molo, which ferry was reached on the 1st of February.
Hkam Leng, however, had left Sumput, and Major Greenaway
moved across the Shwèli to Kyungyaung.</p>

<p>Convinced by the experience of these operations that the
mere movement of troops through the country was ineffectual,
the Chief Commissioner decided to take rougher
measures to bring home to the people of this tract the
power of the Government, and to convince them that they
could not support these disturbers of the peace with
impunity. Orders were issued, therefore, to arrest and
deport the headmen of the villages which aided and
sheltered the two leaders. These orders reached Mr. Shaw
at Kyungyaung and were executed at once. The headmen
of twelve villages who had been most active were arrested
and sent into Bhamo, and at the same time monthly fines
were imposed on their villages. Similar measures were
adopted under Mr. Daniell and Mr. Hertz's supervision in the
circles which had befriended Saw Yan Naing. But in spite
of the efforts of the civil and military officers, who spared
neither themselves nor their men, the capture of Saw Yan
Naing and Hkam Leng was not effected.</p>

<p>The open season was now drawing to a close. It seemed
unlikely that further action on the lines followed hitherto
would have much more success. The Chief Commissioner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
asked Brigadier-General Gatacre to visit the country with
Mr. Shaw and see if they could advise any other measures
more adapted to the nature of the case. Early in March,
with a strong force, General Gatacre visited Si-u Ton Hon
and Lwèseng, north of the Shwèli, and then went southward
through Molo to Manton. He reported the country
through which he passed to be quiet and the people to be
submissive. Leaving a party of one hundred rifles, including
forty Mounted Infantry, at Sipein with Mr. Shaw, to work
the circles north of the Shwèli, and Mr. Daniell with one
hundred rifles at Manton to work south of that river, he
withdrew the remainder of the troops. Proclamations were
issued, with the Chief Commissioner's approval, warning the
people of the consequences of opposing the troops and
promising reduction or remission of the fines that had
been imposed if the leaders of the revolt were surrendered.
On the 28th of March the headmen gave Mr. Shaw a
formal engagement to observe the terms of the proclamation,
and he was able to withdraw the troops and return to
Bhamo.</p>

<p>Before the close of the operations the headman of Manton,
who was one of the most obstinate adherents of Hkam Leng
and had hitherto evaded arrest, was captured by the Kachins
of the neighbouring circles and delivered to Mr. Daniell.
He was deported to Mogok, the headquarters of the Ruby
Mines district. All this country, it should be remembered,
known as the Myauk-Kodaung (the northern nine hills),
estimated to contain 2,500 square miles, belongs to the
Möng Mit State. On the withdrawal of the troops an
official of that State was left in charge with a force of the
Sawbwa's militia to keep order. Before the British troops
left the Kachin Sawbwas entered into solemn engagements
to keep the peace, to shut their hills against Saw Yan Naing,
and to obey the Möng Mit Sawbwa to whom they are
subject.</p>

<p>Some progress had been made by the middle of 1889
towards the establishment of order. The root of the
trouble, however, lay in the weakness of the Möng Mit
administration. The most effectual measure undoubtedly
would have been to place the State directly under the
administration of a British officer. This method of meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
the difficulty was considered and set aside by the Chief
Commissioner. In the earlier years of our rule there were
strong reasons against absorbing any of these quasi-independent
territories. It was our settled policy to maintain
the Shan States in the position they enjoyed under the
Burmese Government. The absorption of one of them
would have alarmed the others just when we were striving
to win their confidence and to bring them peacefully into
the fold. For this reason mainly the Chief Commissioner
refused to wipe out the Kalè State, although in that case
there were much stronger reasons for adopting this course
(<i>vide</i> Chapter XXI., pp. 291, 292), and a desire not to depart
from this line of policy led him to treat Wuntho with forbearance.
In the present instance, moreover, the Möng
Mit chief was a minor; his ministers might be accused of
incapacity but not of dishonesty or hostility.</p>

<p>It was sought by other means to improve the administration
of Möng Mit. Saw Möng, who had been ejected by
his enemies from his hereditary State of Yawnghè (<i>vide</i>
pp. 142-143), at the time of the annexation was selected
as a man of some power and of known loyalty and placed
as regent in Möng Mit. The experiment did not succeed.
Whether from want of sufficient governing power or because,
not being their hereditary chief, he met with little support
from the people, Saw Möng<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> failed, and in 1892 it was found
necessary to place the State temporarily under the Deputy
Commissioner of the Ruby Mines, who governed it as part
of his district until the year 1906, when the young Sawbwa
came of age, and was entrusted with the administration of
his State. He is doing well. Saw Yan Naing and Hkam
Leng did not appear on the scene again. What has become
of them is not known, and it is hardly necessary to inquire.
It is hard to see what use they served except to try the
endurance of our people and to harass the souls of their
compatriots.</p>

<p>The narrative as regards Möng Mit and the territory once
called Möng Leng, now known as the Upper Sinkan township
of Bhamo, has been brought down to the year 1889-90.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>
<p>It is now necessary to go back a year or two and deal with the
range of hills known as Hpon Kan, lying about thirty miles
to the south-east of Bhamo. The Kachins in these hills
began to harass us from the first. Early in 1886 they
attacked Sawadi on the Irrawaddy and exacted tribute from
the Sinkan villages. They raided the open country near
Bhamo several times, and on one occasion even made their
way within our lines, killed some Indian soldiers and burnt
some of the barracks.</p>

<p>They were in reality not of great account. But the first
attempts to deal with them were unfortunate, and after a
time they began to be regarded with a seriousness quite
unmerited. Two military expeditions went from Bhamo in
1886, the objective being Karwan, the village of the most
important chief of the tribe. The first expedition failed to
reach the village and returned without doing anything.
The second in the same year was well managed from a
military point of view, and had forced its way against some
opposition to a point close to Karwan, when the civil officer
with the column, under some misunderstanding of the orders
he had received from the Chief Commissioner, Sir Charles
Bernard, stopped the advance, and the column retired without
effecting the object for which it had been sent. The
result was that the Karwan chieftain and his tribe were
persuaded that the British were afraid to meet them. The
chief would neither submit nor deign to visit the Deputy
Commissioner, and his hill became a rendezvous for the
restless and evil spirits around. Gatherings of Burmese and
Chinese were reported, and it was apprehended at one time
that they would join the rising in Upper Sinkan. They
confined their action, however, to some small raids on
insignificant villages below the hills. In the beginning of
March, 1889, they again descended to the plains and
stockaded themselves at a place named Kyawgaung, killed
the headman and carried off his family. Some troops, sent
out to cover a fatigue party building a post for the police at
Mansi, about fifteen miles from Bhamo, were fired at from
the jungle, and the village of Mansi, consisting of a few
houses, was burnt by the Kachins, and two of the military
police killed.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>
<p>The necessity of punishing the Hpon Kan Kachins for all
their misdeeds had long been admitted. The country round
Bhamo was kept by them in constant alarm, and the failure
to deal with them led to excitement and want of confidence
in the Bhamo bazaar, peculiarly ready to believe absurd
rumours and subject to panic. More urgent matters had
hitherto delayed action, and the garrison of Bhamo had been
so weakened by the despatch of troops to Mogaung, that it
could not afford men for other work. The Chief Commissioner,
therefore, was compelled to wait. Towards the
end of March the return of troops from the north made it
easier to find a force for the Hpon Kan business; and the
opportunity was at once taken of destroying this nest of
hornets, or, to describe them more accurately, mosquitoes.
Sir George White arranged a plan of operations at the Chief
Commissioner's request, and the Commander-in-Chief of the
Madras Army, being at the time in Upper Burma, gave his
approval at once.</p>

<p>The force was of such a strength as to ensure the complete
reduction of the refractory tribes, it was hoped, without
fighting. It consisted of two guns of a mountain battery,
fifty sappers, two hundred and fifty British, two hundred
and fifty Native Infantry, of whom one hundred were
Gurkhas, and was commanded by Brigadier-General George
Wolseley,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> C.B. The civil officers with the force were Mr.
Shaw, Deputy Commissioner of Bhamo, and Mr. Warry, of
the Chinese Consular service, with whose name the reader
is acquainted already (<i>vide</i> Chapter VII.). Regarding the
work of the expedition and the manner in which it
should be carried out, the Chief Commissioner gave full
instructions. The punishment of the Sawbwa of Hpon
Kan and of his people, unless they made timely submission,
was the duty imposed on the force. Notice was to be
given to the Kachins that villages which helped the
advance of the force would be protected; villages from
or near which any opposition was offered would be destroyed;
and on those Kachins who would not submit
as much damage as possible would be inflicted by destruction
of their houses and property. In any case, the village
where the Sawbwa had his residence was to be occupied;
and a fine in money and guns was to be exacted from
him. The amount of the fine was to be fixed by Mr. Shaw
with reference to the Sawbwa's means and to the amount
of damage done in his raids. All captives held by the
Kachins were to be surrendered. If this was impossible
the fines payable by the custom of the country in such
cases were to be exacted. In the event of the Sawbwa
rejecting the terms his village was to be destroyed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>
<p>In view of the former failures, strict orders were given
that negotiations with the Sawbwa were not to be opened
until Karwan, his capital village, was occupied by the
British force. There, and nowhere else, were the terms
of surrender to be settled. And it was added that "under
no circumstances should Mr. Shaw advise the return of
the force or the suspension of operations until the objects
of the expedition should have been accomplished and the
Sawbwa's village occupied." The Chief Commissioner
added that "if it were possible the force should remain
in the Sawbwa's village for some days so as to make his
humiliation apparent to his people and to the neighbouring
tribes." Orders were issued by the Commander-in-Chief
of Madras, Sir Charles Arbuthnot, at the Chief
Commissioner's request, for the troops to remain at
Hpon Kan until the Chief Commissioner should be satisfied
that they could be withdrawn without bad results.</p>

<p>The troops were divided into two columns, and, avoiding
the direct road where the Kachins might be prepared to
oppose us, they took different routes, and after very slight
opposition Karwan was occupied. Our loss was two killed
and three wounded. The Sawbwa did not make his appearance.
Karwan and several other villages were therefore
destroyed. On the 23rd of April the Sawbwa of Washa,
a neighbouring village of another tribe, and the elders of
Neinsin, one of the Hpon Kan villages, the headman of
which was detained as a hostage in Bhamo, came forward
and volunteered to bring in the headmen of Hpon Kan.
They were given two days to make good their offer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>
<p>On the 25th of April they came back with two of the
Karwan elders, who accepted the terms imposed by the
Deputy Commissioner, and promised to bring in the Sawbwa
and other elders. The terms imposed were that fines for
various murders and for the burning of Mansi should be
paid and fifty guns surrendered and captives restored. The
money fine was paid in full and the guns delivered. The
Chief Commissioner thereupon sanctioned the withdrawal
of the troops, and the main body left Karwan on the 15th
of May. Before the evacuation of the place the headmen
of the Hpon Kan villages entered into a solemn
agreement to cease from raiding. This promise has
been kept.</p>

<p>The objects of the expedition were thus accomplished,
and these tribes did not give trouble again.</p>

<p>While General Wolseley was at Karwan, Mr. Daly, the
Superintendent of the Northern Shan States, accompanied
by Mr. Sherriff, a representative of the Rangoon Chamber
of Commerce, came to Nam Kham, on the left bank of the
Shwèli, the chief town of a small State subordinate to
North Hsenwi. It was a good opportunity of joining hands
and examining the road between Hpon Kan and Nam
Kham.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Taking a sufficient escort, General Wolseley
went by a circuitous route, to avoid a neck of Chinese
territory which runs down between the Bhamo district
and North Hsenwi. Leaving Karwan on the 2nd of May,
Wolseley made Nam Kham on the 8th. After two days he
returned to Bhamo with the troops.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>
<p>It may be added, before closing this chapter, that the
Kachin tribes, whom it was necessary to subdue with such
severity, have been for many years furnishing excellent
recruits to the military police; and Kachin detachments,
officered by men of their own race, can now be entrusted
with the charge of frontier outposts.</p>

months to gather materials for her charming book, "Shans at Home."
Writing of the Northern Shans States she says (page 186): "Before the
country was annexed to Great Britain, in 1886, each chief governed his
own State, and the King of Burma was his overlord, to whom he was
obliged to pay a heavy tribute. Burman officials terrorized over the
Shans, and, owing to heavy and unjust taxation, the people were in a
perpetual state of rebellion against their chiefs. The chiefs were constantly
fighting amongst themselves, and were also trying to free
themselves from the Burman rule." The condition of the country
under Burma has been described in the historical chapter of her
book, written by the Rev. Wilbur Willis Cochrane, of the American
Baptist Mission. She goes on: "I should like to draw attention to
the unhappy state of the people under the invasion of the Kachins, who
were slowly but surely taking possession of the hill country." Then
Mrs. Milne quotes from "Parliamentary papers for 1859-76." It is
sufficient to give here only a part of the quotation: "They (the Kachins)
have ousted many Shan tribes, and wherever they appear they assume
the same character of 'lords of all they can reach,' only to be appeased
by some form of 'blackmail.'... They inspire such terror that in the
neighbouring plains no Burman or Shan will venture alone, or even in
company, unarmed along the roads within their reach." "This state of
affairs," Mrs. Milne concludes, "lasted until the British annexation, and
our Government have worked what one might almost call a miracle; for,
the first time since the beginning of Shan history, peace prevails all over
the country."</p></div></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

THE CHINS</h2>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">General Faunce's Expedition</span></div>


<p>The seventeenth chapter told the story of the Sawlapaw
expedition, which covered the time from the spring
1888 to the second month of 1889. The western frontier
of the province was the scene of equally interesting and
much more difficult operations during the same period.
When Upper Burma was annexed it is doubtful whether the
difficulties, that might arise from the wild tribes which
would become our neighbours, received much consideration.
The Burmese Government thought very little of raids
and disturbances on their frontiers. A British Administration
could not show the same indifference.</p>

<p>Along the west of the Upper Burma districts of the
Upper and the Lower Chindwin, of Pakokku, and of
Minbu, lies a wild region of hills, inhabited by semi-savage
tribes known to us as Chins. This mountainous
region forms a wedge very long in comparison to its
width. The broad end marches with the south of Manipur,
the Naga Cachar, and east Sylet hills, and the point rests
on Cape Negrais. It is formed of high, narrow ridges
and deep valleys, all running from north to south, and
the people are split up into numerous tribes and clans
speaking many different dialects. The only system of
government was that of headmen of villages, or at the
most of a small group of villages, and consequently negotiations
with the Chins as a people were impossible.
The principal tribes, with which the present narrative is
concerned are, on the north, the Siyins, including the
Sagyilains, and the Sokte tribe, including the Kanhows;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
in the centre of the country the Tashons and Hakas
(nicknamed by the Burmese Baungshès); and, southward
of them, a number of tribes, Chin-boks among others,
who are less formidable as border neighbours.</p>

<p>Between the hills and the Chindwin, and forming an
enclosure in the Upper Chindwin district, was the little
Shan State of Kalè. Like the States on the Shan plateau,
it was governed by a Sawbwa who had a measure of
independence. Owing to its position, practically, on the
Chindwin, Kalè was much more in subjection to the Government
of Burma than the more distant Shan chiefships. It
was, moreover, exposed to raids from the hill-men, and for
a long time past had suffered much from the Siyin group,
who were the most frequent and barbarous raiders, burning
villages, slaughtering the peasants, and carrying off many
as slaves into the mountains.</p>

<p>At the time of the annexation the Sawbwa of Kalè
was an old man, by name Maung Ket, incapable of
administering his country. On the 1st of January, 1887,
the Chief Commissioner, finding that he could neither
keep order within his territory nor protect it against
enemies from without, caused him to be removed with
some of his officials to Mandalay, and appointed his nephew
to rule in his stead. In November, 1887, Maung Ket
escaped from Mandalay with his followers and took refuge
with the Tashon Chins, who in former years were on
friendly terms with the Kalè State.</p>

<p>In March, 1887, the Deputy Commissioner of the Upper
Chindwin (Captain Raikes) met representatives of the
Tashon tribes at Indin and explained to them that raiding
must be stopped. His warnings seem to have influenced
them; for a whole year few villages were attacked. Several
circumstances, however, had tended to unsettle the minds
of these wild tribes.</p>

<p>The ex-Sawbwa of Kalè had a disturbing influence
and endeavoured no doubt to persuade them to help him to
regain his position. In the open season of 1887-8 a project
for opening up the Chin country from the Bengal boundary
in the west to the frontier of Burma proper on the east was
started in India, prematurely so far as we were concerned.
It was proposed that roads should be made through the
hills, communications established, and the hill people subjugated.
The phrase "from the Salween to the sea" was
invented and had some effect.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">On the Chin Hills&mdash;arranging a plan of attack.</span><br />
Chin-Liushai Campaign.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>
<p>In the winter of 1887 Captain Raikes with another
officer went up the Myittha River and arranged a meeting
with the Tashon chiefs. Sonpek, the principal man of
the tribe, came down from the mountains and met Captain
Raikes on the 3rd of January, 1888. He was courteous,
even friendly in his manner, but guarded in his speech.
His fears were excited by the close questioning (concerning
the routes through his country eastward) to which he
was subjected, so much so that he would hardly accept the
presents offered to him by Captain Raikes. The meeting,
however, ended in outward friendliness on both sides. No
action was taken by the Government towards entering or
approaching the Tashon country, and nothing indicated
that the Chins had been seriously alarmed.</p>

<p>Other events followed which added to their uneasiness.
Captain Raikes had visited Indin in March, 1887, and had
found two persons in the ruling Sawbwa's service whose
intrigues were causing trouble in the Kalè State. One
was Maung Tok San, the other Maung Tha Dun, styled
"Chingeh," or "Minister for the Chins." These two men
were removed by Captain Raikes from Kalè and confined
at Alôn. After some months they were released on security.
They made use of their freedom to escape to the Chin
Hills, where they joined the old Sawbwa who had preceded
them, and helped him to excite the tribes.</p>

<p>It happened at the same time that part of the Pakokku
district on the Lower Chindwin was very much disturbed.
The guerilla leader, known as the Shwègyobyu
Prince, had been able to collect a considerable following
and to raise a small revolt (see Chapter VIII., pp. 84, 85).
Expelled from the low country, he also sought safety with
the Tashons. The arrival of a Burman Prince, whether
genuine or pretender, did not matter, a man with a certain
amount of prestige, a good deal of energy, and a bitter
hatred of the foreigners, gave the Tashons heart, and they
determined to take action. On the 4th and 5th of May
a body of Sonpek's Tashons, numbering some hundreds,
descended on Indin, made the Sawbwa prisoner, and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
him to Chingaing (a village near the foot of the hills),
where he had interviews with Sonpek and the Shwègyobyu
Prince. He promised to join them in their resistance to
the British, and on that condition was allowed to return
to Indin. The Sawbwa, however, kept faith with us.
Getting some men together, he sent them to attack the
Shwègyobyu Prince in Chingaing, and despatched urgent
messengers to the Deputy Commissioner (Mr. Ross) asking
for assistance.</p>

<p>This sudden raid by the Chins on the Kalè State, and
their readiness to assist a pretender like the Shwègyobyu
Prince, had not been foreseen, and took the authorities by
surprise. The messages received at headquarters were
alarming. Eleven hundred Tashon Chins were reported
to have surrounded Indin and carried off the Sawbwa.
Several thousands were said to be on the warpath; five
hundred had occupied Indin, three hundred were marching
on Taungdwin, three hundred on Kalewa&mdash;all these of the
Tashon tribe. Of the Siyins, five hundred were making for
Kalemyo, six hundred threatening the Kabaw Valley, and
so on. The numbers were obviously much exaggerated.
Nevertheless, as the men on the spot thought the situation
serious, measures of precaution had to be taken. A force
under Major Gleig, consisting of 100 rifles, Cheshire
Regiment, 250 Madras Infantry (15th) and two guns, were
sent up the Chindwin River in steamers to Kalemyo. At
the same time 150 Mounted Infantry (100 British, 50
Native), accompanied by Captain Eyre, the Deputy Commissioner
of the district, were despatched from Pakokku,
viâ Pauk and Gangaw, to take the raiders in the rear.
A party of military police from the Kabaw Valley Battalion,
with two guns, were moved down to Kalewa.</p>

<p>These dispositions sufficed to restore order for the time.
Major Gleig's force disembarked at Indin on the 24th
of May; Captain Eyre with the Mounted Infantry was at
Chingaing, a few miles from Indin, on the 26th, the
rifles and guns from the Kabaw Valley arrived at Kalemyo
about the same date. The party, accompanied by Captain
Eyre, marched up through the Yaw country without
meeting with any opposition. They covered 152 miles in
eight days and hoped to surprise the Shwègyobyu, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
with a mixed following of Burmans and Chins, had
continued to hold Chingaing; but as soon as the alarm
was given by his scouts he fired the village and escaped
into the hills. The enemy were encountered only on one
occasion. On the 17th of May a police officer making a
night march with 60 rifles of the military police (Indians)
was attacked by a body of men under Bo Saga, a noted
dacoit leader. The men lately enrolled were unsteady and
fell back, and the party retired, losing two men wounded.
The officer reported that he had found the villages on his
march deserted and that the insurgents were collecting
men and arms. Several Burman villages had been burnt;
men, women, and children had been killed, and many
carried off into the hills. The measures taken may seem
in the recital out of proportion to the danger. But it
was by no means a false alarm.</p>

<p>The rains had now set in, and the Kalè and Yaw country
in that season does not tempt the hill-men to raid. They
returned to their mountains. The disturbances ceased
almost as suddenly as they had begun. The troops returned
to their quarters, a guard of military police being left at
Indin to protect the Sawbwa.</p>

<p>Although order had been restored for the present, it
was evident to the Chief Commissioner that the Chins
had yielded to the climate rather than to fear. They had
escaped punishment; and as they had burnt villages
and returned home with many captives the campaign in
their eyes must have seemed successful.</p>

<p>It was necessary to protect the Yaw Valley which
was our territory, and the Kalè country, the Sawbwa of
which was our dependent and too weak to help himself.
A proposal was made by the local officer to simplify matters
by taking the Kalè State under direct administration.
It was argued that as we were obliged to defend Kalè,
we might as well administer the country and receive the
revenues. Looking, however, to its effect on the minds
of the people, this appeared to be a mistaken policy. Every
Sawbwa in the Shan States might have been degraded
on similar grounds. The Kalè man, so far as was known,
had not been disloyal. In the early part of 1887 he
had acted well, and in the present affair he had not acted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
badly. If he had not been well informed regarding the
movements of the Chins, he was no worse than the British
officers in the district. He was suddenly surrounded
and seized. In procuring his liberty by consenting to
join the insurgents he took the best course, or what
he thought the best course, for himself. He lost no time in
sending information to the nearest officer, and he attacked
the rebel gathering with his own men. To remove him
under such circumstances would have been unfair, and
might have alarmed others whose fears it was not good
policy to arouse.</p>

<p>It was decided, therefore, by the Chief Commissioner not
to absorb Kalè, but to leave a military or police guard at
or near Indin, with supports at Kalewa. An ultimatum
was sent to the Tashons, ordering them to deliver up the
Shwègyobyu Prince and other leading rebels, as well as
the leaders of the Chins who captured the Sawbwa of Kalè
and raided his villages. On the 21st of July, 1888, the Chief
Commissioner (in a minute submitted to the Government
of India) recounted the events which have been narrated,
and gave his opinion that there could be no peace until
the Chin tribes had been subdued. He asked permission
to take the matter in hand as soon as the dry weather
set in, and to subjugate the Chins once for all.</p>

<p>The first step in the plan of campaign was to occupy
in force and permanently the difficult country lying below
the Chin Hills, and to bring it under efficient administrative
control.</p>

<p>For this purpose the Chief Commissioner in June, 1887,
asked the Government of India to raise a frontier battalion
in India for the Yaw Valley. It was assumed, in framing
the plan of campaign, that this battalion would have been
ready before the rains ended, and that it would have been possible
to hold this district firmly. To have attacked the Chins
and to have withdrawn the troops would have been to
leave the villages in the plains exposed to the vengeance
of the hill-men.</p>

<p>The next step was to march an expedition into the
Chin Hills. The force was to be divided into three parts.
The Siyin and Sagyilain tribe was to be invaded from the
Kalè Valley by a force of the Kabaw Valley military police,
brought down for the duty. The Tashon country was to
be entered simultaneously by a column of regular troops
with two guns, having its base at Sihaung on the Myittha
River, to which place the men, their baggage, and supplies,
could be brought by water. At the same time a force
collected at Gangaw was to threaten the Yokwa Haka
and Thatta Chins, to prevent them from helping the
Tashons.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>
<p>The subjugation of the Tashons was judged to be the
most formidable task. The object was to reach and, if
necessary, to destroy their chief village in Burmese Ywama.
There were no roads, only difficult hill-paths. Hill-coolies
and mules were necessary for transport. There were no
supplies in the country. The work, therefore, would have
to be taken in hand leisurely, the road cleared and made
practicable for mules, supply-stations established, and
nothing left to chance. A slow, determined advance, it
was held, would have a greater moral effect than an
attempt by forced marches to surprise the enemy. If it
were possible a simultaneous attack should be made from
the Arakan or Chittagong Hills on the west to take the
Tashons in the rear.</p>

<p>In reply to the ultimatum sent to them (see above),
the Tashons released the captives taken in the raids on
the 18th and 19th of May, but declined to give up the
Shwègyobu Prince and other Burman rebels. They put
forward counter-claims on their own part, and threatened
further raids if their demands were not complied with.</p>

<p>In August an order was sent to the chief of the Siyin
and Sagyilain tribes to surrender the captives taken by
them from several villages in the preceding April and
July, and they were warned that if they did not comply
with this demand punishment would follow.</p>

<p>Early in September raiding began again. While the
Government of India were considering the Chief Commissioner's
proposals the Chins acted. They put their threats
into execution. A village near Sihaung was raided by the
Tashons on the 17th of September, and an alliance was
formed by a large number of subdivisions of the Haka
tribe. On the 18th of September a village in the Gangaw
circle of the Pakokku district was attacked, it was reported,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
by Tashons. It was clear to the local officers that the
anticipation of serious trouble would be realized. The
Government of India were pressed, therefore, to allow the
immediate enlistment of the military police levy for the
protection of the Chin frontier, which had been asked for
early in June. In October the reply of the Governor-General
in Council to the Chief Commissioner's minute of July 21st
was received. It was a refusal to sanction the proposed
expeditions.</p>

<p>About this time the local officers reported that Sonpek,
the Tashon leader, was inclined to give up the Burman
refugees, but that he would not surrender the old Sawbwa of
Kalè. It was just possible that through the latter's influence
Sonpek's inclination might be translated into
action. The old Sawbwa, therefore, was informed that he
would be pardoned for his part in the disturbances if he
brought about the surrender of the Burman rebels by the
Tashons. At the same time, as a precaution against the
attacks which were anticipated, Kalewa and Sihaung were
garrisoned, and endeavours made to prevent the Chins from
getting their usual supplies of salt and other necessaries
from the plains.</p>

<p>The country lying between the Chin mountains and the
Chindwin and Irrawaddy Rivers is, speaking generally, what
would be called in India "terai"; covered with large
stretches of forest and intersected by numerous watercourses
and streams, with a heavy rainfall and intense heat.
It is very unhealthy and a difficult country for troops to
work in. The main river in this track is the Myittha,
which rises from the southern part of the Chin mountains;
it runs almost due north for a hundred miles or more, and
then turning suddenly to the east for fifteen or twenty miles
joins the Chindwin at Kalewa. During its course northward
it receives by many affluents the drainage of the eastern
slopes of the Chindwin. Three ranges of thickly wooded
hills, called the Pondaung Ranges, run parallel to the Myittha
on the east, with intervening valleys which are fertile and
cultivated. East of the third range of hills lies the Pagyi
township of the Lower Chindwin district. In the west of
this township, bordering on the hills above mentioned,
is the country known as Shitywagyaung&mdash;"the valley of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
eight villages"&mdash;of which the most important is Thitkyidaing.
West of this village lie Saga and Kyaw. The
country lying between the Myittha River and the range of
hills on the east is known as the Yaw country, in the
southern part of which is the Yaw River, which rises in the
same hills as the Myittha, but, turning in a south-easterly
direction, makes its way to the Irrawaddy below Pakokku,
the river-port of the district in which the Yaw country lies.
Gangaw is the chief village in the Yaw country, and is
more than 100 miles from Pakokku. The road to it passes
through Pauk at about the twentieth mile, and the Yaw
River, which has to be crossed, is unfordable when in flood.</p>

<p>In 1888 the country about Thitkyidaing had not been
thoroughly reduced, chiefly on account of its unhealthiness
and the scarcity of civil officers. Mr. Carter and Colonel
Symons worked this tract in 1887-8, and brought it to
order after the disturbances raised by the Shwègyobyu
Prince, in which Major Kennedy and Captain Beville,
Assistant Commissioner, met their deaths. Many of the
dacoit leaders were captured or killed at that time, but the
country was not thoroughly controlled.</p>

<p>There was so much to do in the early years of the
annexation and so few to do it, that outlying tracts like
the Yaw country were neglected for a time. This tract had,
it is believed, even in the King's time, been left very much
to itself. In 1887 the Deputy Commissioner of Pakokku
(Captain Eyre) visited it. The people received him well.
An arrangement&mdash;the best possible at the time&mdash;was made
with the local officials, who undertook to pay the revenue
and to be responsible for the order and protection of the
territory. Hitherto the people had defended themselves
against the Chins; and, to encourage them, five or six
hundred muskets were distributed to villagers who in the
opinion of the Burman officials would make good use of
them. In some cases a subsidy was given to pay for the
maintenance of a rude militia or irregular police. This
arrangement had worked well until the time of the events
now to be told, and it had the recommendation of economy
in money and men when economy was more than usually
imperative.</p>

<p>The refusal of the Government of India to allow an expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
into the Chin country in no way absolved the Chief
Commissioner from the duty of protecting the people
against these savages, for which purpose he had sufficient
means at his disposal. He therefore took counsel with the
Major-General commanding in Upper Burma (Sir George
White) as to the measures necessary. It was resolved to
move a body of troops up from Pakokku through Gangaw
along the whole line of the frontier subject to raids,
and to establish a chain of posts, Tilin, Gangaw, Kan,
Sihaung, Kambalè, and Indin. General Faunce, who commanded
the military district in which the disturbed tracts
were situated, was given the control of the operations.
Major Raikes, who was at the time in charge of the Lower
Chindwin, and had had more intercourse with the Chins
than any other of the civil officers, was associated with
General Faunce and entrusted with the political duties. A
force about 500 strong was ordered to move up along the
frontier with General Faunce, while three companies of
Gurkhas were to be sent by river to Kalewa. No preparations
were made for attacking the Chin strongholds in the
hills, as the Government in India had forbidden it. Raiding
parties were to be followed up and punished whenever
and so far as it might be possible.</p>

<p>The Chins began to act before these arrangements had
been completed. Reports of raiding came tumbling in fast.
On the 14th of October Homalin was attacked by followers
of the Shwègyobyu, assisted by Chins from the Tashon
country. On the 17th Chitpauk, in the Kabaw Valley, was
raided by Siyins, who killed seven and carried off forty-five
villagers. On the 20th of October Kambalè was surrounded,
two villagers were murdered and six kidnapped. On the
22nd of October the Siyins attacked Kantha, north of Kan,
and made off with thirty-two villagers. On the 29th of
October a large body of the hill-men came down on Kalémyo,
the principal village in Kalè. They burnt part of it, killed
three of the villagers, wounded four, and carried forty into
slavery. On the same day Khampat, in the Kabaw Valley,
was raided by a party of Kanhows, seven men were killed
and twenty-seven taken away.</p>

<p>These occurrences gave the Chief Commissioner a text
for again preaching the need of punishing these unruly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
mountaineers; and, meanwhile, such measures as were
possible and within his powers were taken. On the 9th
of November the Government of India intimated that they
were inclined to reconsider the proposal of the Burman
Administration. On the 16th their orders came, giving
the Chief Commissioner a free hand to do what he could
with the troops at his disposal, and with the transport to be
had within the province.</p>

<p>General Faunce had left Pakokku on the 14th of
November. Captain Eyre, the Deputy Commissioner of
Pakokku, went with him. His orders were to give all
the help possible to the General, especially in procuring
transport. He was to retain charge of the Pakokku
district, and was not to go beyond its limits. The
force accompanying General Faunce consisted of 356 men
of the 10th Madras Infantry, 49 Mounted Infantry of the
10th Bengal Infantry, and 50 lances of the 1st Madras
Lancers. As they went forward posts were established
at Chaungu, 7-1/2 miles north of Pauk, at Tilin, at Gangaw,
and at Kan on the Myittha, 20 miles north of Gangaw, and
at Sihaung, between Kan and Indin.</p>

<p>The garrisons at Gangaw and at Kan were strong,
170 rifles at each place, all of the 10th Regiment Madras
Infantry. At Sihaung the strength was 250 rifles.
Hitherto, as has been explained before, the task confided
to General Faunce was to protect the frontier, to stop
raids, and, if possible, to pursue and account for the
raiding parties.</p>

<p>The sanction given by the Government of India on the
16th of November completely altered the character of the
movement. It became primarily a punitive expedition
against the Chins. The 1st Bengal Mountain Battery,
77 strong, with 6 guns, 58 Madras sappers, and three
companies of the 44th Gurkhas, were sent up by steamer
to Kalewa; and by the time the General arrived at Kambalè,
which he made his headquarters and the base of his
expedition, he had a force of twelve hundred men (650
being Gurkhas) under his orders, besides between 200 and
300 military police (Indians), who held Indin and Kalewa,
and were placed at his disposal.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the change of policy, transport<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
became an urgent question&mdash;in fact the main question.
The military authorities asked for two thousand coolies,
men that could carry loads in the hills. The Deputy
Commissioner, Captain Eyre, believed that he could get
the men, and at the instance of the General commanding,
the Chief Commissioner consented to allow Captain Eyre
to go with this large body of coolies if he could enlist
them, and an officer was ordered up to Pakokku to take
charge of the district and to set Captain Eyre free for
this purpose. This fact is mentioned, as it explains in
a measure how the Deputy Commissioner's attention was
somewhat distracted from his immediate duty&mdash;the administration
of the district for which he was responsible.</p>

<p>Captain Eyre accompanied General Faunce as far as
Kan, near the northern boundary of the Pakokku district.
He then left him, meaning to return to Gangaw for the
purpose of collecting coolies. He had information of
several gatherings of dacoits, under known leaders, in the
hills north-east of Gangaw, and at Mozo, north of Kan,
and some time was spent in looking after them. He
heard of a body of dacoits in position in the bed of a
stream, between two thickly wooded banks in a strongly
stockaded camp. The dacoits were taken by surprise,
and their camp was rushed and destroyed. Pursuit was
impossible, owing to the nature of the country, and there
was nothing to be done except to return to Kan. The
enemy harassed the retiring party all the way, and our
men had continually to turn and drive them off.</p>

<p>Next day reports came in that the villagers were joining
the dacoits, and that a body of some hundreds were collected
at Chaungzon. After arranging with the officer commanding
at Kan that a party should be sent to attack this
gathering, Captain Eyre returned to Gangaw to collect
the coolies wanted by General Faunce. He reached
Gangaw on the 11th, and busied himself with this duty.
On the 16th of December, hearing that three of the dacoit
leaders were in considerable strength at Kunze, north-east
of Gangaw, a force of 105 rifles, 10th Madras Infantry,
attacked and dispersed them, but without inflicting serious
loss. From that date the garrison of Gangaw may be
said to have done nothing. They sat still and allowed the
rising to gather strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Seeing the dacoit bands active and gathering strength,
while the British officers and the garrison were apparently
helpless, the villagers, to whom guns had been given, the
quasi-militia men amongst the foremost, joined the
insurgents. It was another object-lesson in the folly of
arming the Burmese peasantry, and the still greater folly
of allowing an Asiatic foe to think you are afraid to attack
him. The town of Gangaw was defended by a stockade
of teak. The military post had been so placed as to rest
on this stockade, and would have become untenable if
the enemy had succeeded in occupying the town. The
garrison of 170 men had therefore to defend the town
stockade, nearly a mile in extent. It was not considered
strong enough to hold the town and at the same
time to move against the hostile bands, who had now
gathered in considerable numbers, and were occupying a
village called Shonshé on the south, and three villages on
the north-west. On the 24th of December a convoy with
supplies left Gangaw for Kan, which was the next post to
the north. It was fired upon soon after leaving Gangaw,
and lost two men killed and two wounded. From Kan this
party went on to Sihaung, from which place it returned.
It was again attacked on the march back, between Sihaung
and Kan, and lost heavily. Meanwhile the enemy, who had
been strengthened from the peasantry around, attacked
Gangaw on the 30th of December, and again on the 31st.
They were reckoned to number 500 men, but their attacks
inflicted no loss on the garrison.</p>

<p>Some sort of council of war, in which both civil and
military officers joined, now took place, and it was held
that if a determined attack were made on Gangaw or Kan
it must succeed. The garrison of Kan, therefore, was
ordered into Gangaw, and they obeyed the order, to say
the least, without reluctance. They met with no opposition
on the way, but they brought with them reports of the loss
suffered by the detachment which went to Sihaung, which
helped further to depress the dispirited garrison.</p>

<p>In Gangaw itself, although it was assaulted daily until
the 6th of January, when a relieving force arrived, there
were no casualties. The enemy was contemptible, and
even his numbers were, it is believed, exaggerated. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
danger was created by the inaction of the defence rather
than by the number or the enterprise of the assailants.</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner was in Rangoon during the
early days of December. The first news of the trouble
came to him in a telegram from Major Raikes, who was
on special duty on the Chin frontier; it was dated the
14th of December, from Gaungu on the Myittha, and was
received in Rangoon on the 17th. It reported the attack
made on the dacoit camp by Captain Eyre on the 9th of
December, and recommended that troops should be sent
against this gang. In reply, Major Raikes was reminded
that all the troops and military police on the frontier were
under the General's orders and were close to the scene of
action, while it would take a fortnight or more to send
troops up from Pakokku. On the 20th of December a
second telegram came from Major Raikes, reporting the
affair at Chaungzon on the 13th of December. He
explained that General Faunce had ordered the officer
commanding at Gangaw to deal effectively with these
gatherings; that two attempts, both unsuccessful, had
been made to disperse the band near Chaungzon; that
a third attack was about to be made, but the force
ordered to make it could only be spared for a few days,
as the General wanted all his men for frontier patrols
and for the expedition into the hills. He therefore pressed
for reinforcements as necessary for the destruction of these
gangs.</p>

<p>Orders were then given for a small column of military
police and troops to march up at once from
Pakokku. The Deputy Commissioner of the Lower
Chindwin was told to send all the police he could spare
across from Alôn to the disturbed area. The state of
things was communicated by telegram to Sir George White,
who was on the Chindwin on his way to Kalewa, and the
despatch of reinforcements from Pakokku was suggested.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day the first reports from Captain Eyre
himself came in. He described the insurgents as increasing
in numbers rapidly, and begged for more troops. This was
the first intimation received by the Chief Commissioner
that the local officers were unable to cope with the rising
and that it was of a serious character. The Commissioner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
was thereupon ordered to Pakokku to hasten the dispatch of
the small column previously mentioned; and lest there
should be difficulty in finding Sir George White, the
officer commanding at Myingan was asked to get a force
ready for immediate despatch. On the 26th a message
came from Sir George White, dated from Mingin on the
Chindwin, that he had ordered the despatch of a force
200 strong from Pakokku <i>via</i> Pauk, and Major Kingston
with 250 rifles, troops and military police, from Alôn, to
hasten to Gangaw. At the same time Colonel Macgregor,
with 150 rifles of the 44th Gurkhas, who were with
General Faunce, was ordered down from Sihaung to
Gangaw. Meanwhile the Chief Commissioner had sent
up 125 rifles of the Pakokku military police, under Lieutenant
Phillips, by forced marches by the Kyaw Valley
route. Major Kingston and Lieutenant Phillips joined
hands at Kyaw on the 2nd of January. On the 6th they
attacked the insurgents in Shonshé, south of Gangaw, and
drove them out with considerable loss. At the same
moment Colonel Macgregor with his Gurkhas fell upon
the bands who were occupying a village north of Gangaw,
and handled them roughly. No stand was made by these
people, who had kept nearly 350 Madras Infantry shut up
in Gangaw.</p>

<p>The duty of restoring order in the Yaw country was
entrusted to Colonel W. P. Symons, who had displayed
great ability in dealing with dacoit gangs in Sagaing. He
was assisted by Mr. D. Ross, as civil officer in charge of
the district. The country was cleared of dacoits, partially
disarmed, and reduced to order. The rank and file of the
insurgents were allowed to return to their homes, the guilty
villages being punished collectively by fines. The Yaw
country has been peaceful ever since.</p>

<p>The Gangaw episode was, in the language of the Boer
War, "a regrettable incident." The garrison at the outset
may have been unable to face the insurgents in the field,
but, after the Kan detachment had been called in, it
numbered 340 rifles&mdash;a sufficient number of disciplined
troops to deal with a much larger number of dacoits, a
mere rabble, armed, when they were armed at all, with old
muzzle-loading rifles, or still more ancient muskets. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
incident was not, however, barren of good results. It sufficed
to convince even the most devoted admirer of "the old
coast army" that a portion of the Madras troops was unfit
for active service&mdash;a fact which had more than once been
brought to notice by the Chief Commissioner. The disbanding
of the regiment responsible for the failure was the
beginning of a large measure of army reform that had
been too long delayed. Hence these events, trivial in themselves,
may be worth recording.</p>

<p>The narrative may now return to the central business,
namely, the expedition against the Chins.</p>

<p>General Faunce arrived at Kambalè and assumed command
of the operations on the 3rd of December. On the
7th the fighting began. A working-party sent to establish
a post between Kambalè and the foot of the hills was fired
on, and Lieutenant Palmer, R.E., who commanded the
Madras Sappers, was killed. On the 10th of December a
strong body of Chins of the Tashon tribe suddenly issued
from the hills, and attacked the camp of the 42nd Gurkhas
at Sihaung, and a simultaneous attack was made on the
village. They paid dearly for their audacity. The Gurkhas
drove them off, followed them up, and inflicted heavy loss
on them. On the same date Indin, the capital of the Kalè
Sawbwa, was fired into, and the military police post of
Kangyi, twenty miles north of Kalemyo, was attacked.</p>

<p>It had been intended to limit the operations of the
season 1888-9 to the Siyin and Sagyilaing tribes. In
dealing with savage people it is not possible to lay down
a line beyond which you will not step. In view, therefore,
of the probable necessity of taking action against the
Tashons, 200 rifles of the Norfolk Regiment, 50 Madras
sappers, and the remaining companies of the 42nd Gurkhas
from their quarters at Bernardmyo, were ordered to the front.
Sir George White himself arrived at Kalewa on the 29th of
December, but left to General Faunce the immediate command
of the force in the field. Matters were further
complicated by the appearance of another section of the
Chins. In October, a village in the Kubo Valley had
suffered from a raid by Kanhows. A large body of this
tribe came down in December and attacked Kangyi, north
of Kalemyo. It was held by military police, who repulsed
them. Further investigations made it clear that these
Kanhows were so closely related by position and ties of
kindred to the Siyins and Sagyilains as to make them
indistinguishable. A proposal, therefore, to include them in
the operations against the latter was sanctioned. It was
proposed also to send at the same time a column to Minlèdaung,
on the borders of the Tashon country, but this was
not found convenient and was dropped.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 281px;">
<a href="images/m375.png"><img src="images/m375-t.png" width="281" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>An ultimatum was now sent to the Siyins and Sagyilains,
demanding the restoration of all their captives, the
surrender of a certain number of fire-arms, and the payment of
a fine. In default of the acceptance of these terms, General
Faunce was told to destroy the villages of the tribes and by
a rigorous blockade to prevent food supplies from reaching
the hills. During December and January preparations for
the advance occupied the attention of the General and his
staff. Transport coolies were obtained from Manipur. A
road was begun, and step by step the base of operations
advanced towards the goal of the expedition, the main
village of the Siyins, called Koset by them.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of January, 1889, Sir George White and
General Faunce made a reconnaissance to the summit of
the Letha Range, to an altitude of 8,200 feet above sea-level.
The force then advanced steadily up the hills in the
face of a continued but unsuccessful opposition; the
sappers, assisted by coolies, making a road as the men
climbed up, and constructing rough stockades in which the
men slept and rations were stored. The advance was
obstructed by formidable stockades, generally held by the
enemy, but not firmly defended. Day and night the Chins
ambushed our men, taking advantage of every suitable
position. The following telegram from Sir George White
to the Chief Commissioner, dated the 28th of January,
1889, describes one of the skirmishes: "Enemy yesterday
attacked our working-party on road above this, and held
our covering-party, 40 British and 100 Gurkhas, from 9 till
2, when I arrived and ordered their positions to be charged.
We carried all, driving them entirely away, getting off
ourselves wonderfully cheaply&mdash;only one Norfolk dangerously
wounded. Enemy in considerable numbers, using
many rifles and plenty of ammunition. They fired at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
1,000 rounds, standing resolutely until actually charged,
even trying to outflank us. Their loss probably about
eight or ten, but they were carried down the Khuds at
once. Most difficult enemy to see or hit I ever fought."</p>

<p>On the 4th of February the village of Koset was reached,
and after a slight resistance, occupied. It was fired by the
Siyins before they retreated, and was reduced to ashes before
our men reached it. The enemy harassed the camp every
night, firing into it from the higher ground, and at several
villages they ineffectually opposed us. They opened communications
at one time with the political officer, but as
they continued ambushing and firing on the troops and
refused to surrender the Burman captives, it was evident
that they were fooling us. Step by step, therefore, the
advance was made good, until the Siyin territory had been
overrun, and by the 5th of March all their villages were
in our hands. The site of the village of Tôklaing was
chosen as the headquarters of the Chin expeditionary force,
and its name was changed to "Fort White," and a post
was built there with materials taken from the village.</p>

<p>The chastisement inflicted on the Siyins had some little
effect on the Kanhows, who had made similarly insincere
overtures. On the 24th of February a deputation of them
came to Fort White, bringing presents and asking that their
villages might be spared. With the Chief Commissioner's
approval, terms were offered to them, namely: to surrender
all the captives in their hands, and a portion of their
fire-arms; to pay a fine of 1,000 rupees, and to engage to
pay a light annual tribute as a token of submission. Ten
days were given them to consider and accept these terms.
On the 6th of March they returned, bringing six of the
captives and presents, but failed to comply with the other
conditions. Their presents, therefore, were refused, and on
the 8th of March General Faunce moved against them.
The force was actively engaged against them until the 20th
of March, when it returned to Fort White. The operations
were well planned and executed, and imposed great labour
on the troops, as the mountain tracks were most precipitous
and difficult. Most of the villages were destroyed, in many
cases by the Chins themselves, and large stores of grain
and other food-supplies were taken. April was occupied
in negotiations with the Tashons, and the troops
rested.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">In the Second Defile of the Irrawaddy below Bhamo.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>
<p>As it was ascertained that the Siyins had built a new
Gurkha village at Tartan, which had been taken in the
earlier operations, a force consisting of 65 rifles of the
2nd Battalion Norfolk Regiment and 60 rifles of the 42nd
Gurkha Light Infantry was sent to drive the Chins out.
The village was strongly stockaded and obstinately defended.
One of the two stockades was taken. The loss on our side
was one officer (Second-Lieutenant Michel) and two men
of the Norfolk Regiment killed, one Gurkha killed, and
two officers and six men wounded. In this action Captain
Le Quesne, of the Army Medical Corps, showed conspicuous
courage in attending to Lieutenant Michel, and was awarded
the Victoria Cross. The troops retired to Fort White
without completing their work. A few days later they
returned and destroyed the village and stockades unopposed.</p>

<p>The rains, which begin early in this region, had now set
in, and active operations ceased. In this business, from
first to last, including the engagements of Gangaw and
Kan, our loss amounted to 26 killed and 54 wounded;
the enemy's loss can only be conjectured&mdash;it was probably
light. The main object now was to secure the
peaceful submission of the Tashons. Towards the end of
March they showed an inclination to parley, and sent letters
purporting to come from six of their chiefs. It was decided
to give them as much time as possible to consider the terms
offered to them, and in the meanwhile no movement was
to be made against their villages or certain settlements of
the Kanhows which were within, or close to, the borders
of the Tashon tribe. One of the Kalè officials, Maung
Nwa, was selected to take a letter to the chiefs, giving
them twenty-one days to decide on their course of
action.</p>

<p>Maung Nwa succeeded in reaching Falam, the Ywama, or
mother-village, of the Tashons. On the 18th of April he
returned to Fort White, bringing letters from the chiefs
and from the ex-Sawbwa of Kalè. A minor chief accompanied
him, and on a subsequent day another Tashon chief
came in with messages to Major Raikes. This beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
of personal intercourse was encouraging, and on our part
concessions were made in respect of the surrender of the
Burmese refugees, while the release of the captives was
insisted on. Later on some overtures were made on the
part of the Siyins and a few captives delivered to our
officers. On the 2nd of May men from the Kanhow tribe
came in; they brought the fine of Rs. 1,000, which had been
imposed on them, and the tribute, and tendered the submission
of their tribe, but no captives. They clung to
their captives as to life. Later on, however, they released
some and brought them to Fort White. It was believed
at the time that they had given up all; it was discovered
later that they had held back a considerable number. The
Siyins surrendered seven captives; but they made no further
steps towards submission. At the end of the open season
of 1888-9 the situation was this: Severe punishment
had been inflicted on the offending tribes, and 114 of
the Burmans carried off by raiding parties had been
recovered. The Siyins and Sagyilains, notwithstanding
the destruction of their villages, had not given in; the
Kanhows had made a show of submission, and had partly
complied with our terms; the Tashons had exchanged
messages, but had given no proof of penitence.</p>

<p>It was necessary to show the Chins that the arm of the
British Government was long enough to reach them even
in their mountain fortresses, and that our soldiers could
remain in their country. It was decided, therefore, to
keep the troops at Fort White during the rains and to
prevent the Chins, who had not submitted, from rebuilding
their villages or cultivating their fields. A rigorous blockade
of the routes from their hills to the plains was ordered, in
the hope that it would help to overcome their obstinacy.
Nothing more could be done until the season for taking the
field again came round.</p>

<p>General Faunce's column had done all that men could do
in a very difficult and unknown country against a very
difficult enemy, pronounced by a man who had seen some
fighting to be "the most difficult enemy to see or hit I ever
fought." The expedition was late in starting. The reason
has been explained. That the next season's operations
were more successful with less severity is no reproach to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
the General commanding the first expedition or to the
political officer. Their work had made our power felt, and
had given us some knowledge of the people. If a garrison
had not been established at Fort White in 1888-9, it
would have been scarcely possible to have acted against the
Tashons on the plan which ensured success in 1889-90.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

THE CHIN-LUSHAI CAMPAIGN</h2>


<p>General Faunce and his men had worked hard
and well. By May, 1888, the advance had been made
good as far as Tôklaing, called Fort White. But although
that place was only a short distance (thirty miles) from
Falam, the main settlement of the Tashons, we had not
been able to reach it. This tribe was known to be the
most numerous and the most influential of the Chins in
these parts, and their subjugation was essential.</p>

<p>The character of the country which was the scene of
operations has been described in the preceding chapter.
For a successful effort to conquer it much and timely
preparation was necessary. Several circumstances had
made this impossible. It will be remembered, in the first
place, the Government of India had viewed the enterprise
askance. The head of an Indian province looks mainly
to his own affairs; and not having a free hand, and being
without direct responsibility for the financing of a military
expedition, he presses hard for what he wants. To the
Supreme Government, far from the scene of raids and
disorder, and less directly concerned with the causes and
consequences of them, the financial aspect looms largest.
The Government of India were beginning to take alarm
at the heavy burden with which the annexation of the
new province was loading them. They were aware of
the very wide extent of territory under the nominal sway
of the dethroned King, and of the distant boundaries, ill-defined
and seemingly endless, marching not only with
China and Siam, but with savage peoples of whom hardly
the names were known. They feared, naturally enough,
that the local authorities might allow their zeal to push<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
them on too hastily if not too far. Little was known
about the relations of the King's Government to the wide
region lying between the Irrawaddy Valley and the Mekong.
The northern and north-eastern boundaries were very indistinctly
defined, and no thought had been given to the great
wedge of mountainous country between Burma proper and
Bengal.</p>

<p>The end of 1888 found us engaged in all these outlying
regions. Active operations were going on in the Shan
States, in the difficult hills east of Bhamo, and in the
rugged country about the Ruby Mines. In the far north
there were disturbances all around Mogaung, which was
inadequately garrisoned and difficult to get at. Added to
this, there were still districts of Upper Burma which were
harassed by gangs of guerillas. There was more than
enough work for every soldier and every civilian in the
country and for every penny that the Treasury could afford.
Facts, however, had proved strong, and the Chins themselves
forced us to act. But General Faunce's force started
too late, and therefore without adequate preparation for a
big campaign. Added to this came the unfortunate Gangaw
affair, which interrupted his supplies and called off some of
his best troops.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1889 the position at Fort White was
hardly encouraging. The place had proved very unhealthy,
and the garrison had few men fit for service. Not only had
we failed to touch the Tashons, who had been chiefly
responsible for the troubles of the past year, but we were
far from having come to terms with the Siyins and
Kanhows, on which tribes our hand had been heavy. The
political officer, indeed, still believed that hunger would
bring them in. The Kanhows had made a partial and
half-hearted submission, retaining, however, most of their
Burman captives. The others would have no truck with
us, and treated our demands, as well as our advances,
with obstinate silence. Their courage was higher, and
the pressure on them less than had been thought. The
Baungshès, moreover, to the south of the Tashons, including
the Yokwa Haka and Thetta clans, had been continuously
on the warpath, and had had no communication
with our officers since the winter of 1887.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>There were only two courses open&mdash;either to make a
well-prepared systematic advance into the Chin Hills and
bring these people under British rule, not necessarily
administration in the full meaning; or to retire altogether
and leave an <i>enclave</i> of savagery between Burma and Bengal,
trusting for the protection of the Burman villages to frontier
posts and spasmodic expeditions. The long history of the
dealings of the Bengal Government with the Lushais and
Nagas, very similar people, had proved the futility of the
latter course. The inclination in Burma was all for the
former, and this met with the thorough approval of the
Supreme Government. The work was to be undertaken
in a whole-hearted manner that would ensure success.</p>

<p>During the inactive season of 1889, the scheme of operations
was carefully worked out. The plan of campaign approved
by the Supreme Government was very much on the lines
sketched in the Chief Commissioner's minute of the 21st of
July, 1888. The central object was the Tashon tribe.
On their north we already had in Fort White a footing
in the hills with communications secured to Kalewa, on
the Chindwin. It was decided to make the attack from
the Burma side in two strong columns. The Northern
Column was to gather at Fort White, and was to deal in
the first instance with the still refractory tribes in its
immediate neighbourhood. The Southern Column was to
muster at Pakokku and, making its base at Kan in the
Myittha Valley, to move up deliberately into the hills to
Yokwa and Haka, subjugating the villages as the force
advanced and securing the release of the captives. Then,
leaving a garrison in Haka, it was to move northward
and, in combination with the Fort White Column, to make
a simultaneous attack on Falam, the Tashon capital, from
both sides. Meanwhile, a third force was to enter the hills
from Bengal territory and open communications or, if
necessary, join hands with the Burma columns. For
the operations of this last force the Burma Administration
had no responsibility.</p>

<p>To protect the villages in the plains from raids and to
keep open communications while the expeditions were in
progress, it was decided to establish ten posts along the
more northern portion of the Chin-Burman frontier. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
force to be employed from Burma was to be nearly four thousand
fighting men, besides some military police. The
number of transport animals and of coolies necessary for
such a body would be very great. Carts were useless after
the first few marches from the Irrawaddy. Some fodder
for ponies and bullocks might be procurable, but it was
certain that once in the hills almost every ounce of food
for man and beast would have to be sent up from the
Irrawaddy Valley.</p>

<p>The success of the campaign, therefore, was a question of
transport and supply. Kan, which was to be the base of
the Southern Column, was to be fed from Pakokku on the
Irrawaddy, distant 165 miles through difficult and sparsely
inhabited country. Work had been begun in 1888 on
the road; but labour was scarce and the cart-track was not
open for more than half the distance. Provisions for Fort
White and its communications, as well as for the frontier
posts, could be sent up by steamer to Kalewa on the Chindwin.
The difficulty was to move them thence to Kalemyo
within reach of the troops. If the Myittha were navigable,
it would be invaluable; all the frontier posts from Kalemyo
to Kan were on that river, but its waters were unknown.
Mules and coolies in large numbers, men from Assam and
from the Northern Punjab able to carry loads on hill
paths, were promised by India. Arrangements for collecting
some eight or nine hundred carts at Pakokku were
put in train; and contracts for the hire of country
boats, of which Pakokku is the great building centre,
were given.</p>

<p>In August I went up the Chindwin to Kalewa to meet
Major Raikes, who had been stationed at Fort White since
the close of the active operations, and had been busy
acquiring information of the people and country and
endeavouring to induce the Chins to come to terms. I
brought with me two naval officers&mdash;Captain Wilson, R.N.,
then Port Officer at Rangoon, and Commander Holland, of
the Royal Indian Marine Service. These officers were
deputed to ascertain how far the Myittha could be navigated;
and, as their inquiries gave reason for hoping that the river
might be navigable, the task of exploring it was entrusted
to Commander Holland. The results of his work were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
encouraging, and he was directed to organize a transport
service of boats.</p>

<p>But to return to Kalewa. The Chief Commissioner, after
discussing matters closely with Major Raikes, resolved to
inform the Tashons that the British Representative, with an
armed force, would proceed to Falam, their head village,
and there receive the submission of the tribe, and if necessary
enforce it. A proclamation to that effect was sent
to the chiefs in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A British army will march to the Tashon Ywama.
The British Government wishes to preserve your tribe,
and does not desire to punish you as it has punished
the Kanhows and Siyins who have resisted the British
forces.</p>

<p>"The British Government desires from you only two
things: First, that the captives taken from Burman villages
shall be released. Secondly, that you shall in the
future behave peacefully, and cease to attack the subjects
of the Government.</p>

<p>"Therefore the Chief Commissioner hereby declares and
promises that you will be excused from punishment for the
past if you comply with the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"(i) That you shall assist the British troops in their
march through your country to your Ywama, and
that you will neither attack nor oppose them;</p>

<p>"(ii) That you shall to the utmost of your power compel
the Siyin and Kanhow tribes to surrender their
captives.</p>

<p>"(iii) That the chiefs shall meet the officer in command
of the British forces at the Ywama, and deliver
up to him all the captives in the possession of
your tribe and pay a fine of 10,000 rupees.</p>

<p>"(iv) That you shall render annually a tribute of two
elephant tusks and ten silk pieces to the British
Government.</p></blockquote>

<p>"If you comply with these terms your lives and property
will be spared, and the former orders requiring you to
deliver up the Shwègyobyu and other rebels will not be
enforced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the other hand, if you will not comply with these
conditions the Chief Commissioner will direct the troops
to punish you severely."</p>

<p>Up to this time the surrender of the Burman outlaws
had been made a condition of peace with the Tashons. It
was now said by those who knew them best that the
surrender of the refugees was repugnant to Chin honour;
and in the hope of making it easier for them to yield, the
Chief Commissioner consented to waive this demand. Permission
was also given to Major Raikes to reduce the fine,
if it would make negotiations more hopeful. But on the
other points, especially the condition that the troops should
march to Falam, their capital, and there receive the formal
and public submission of the chiefs to the British Government,
no concession whatever was to be made. Negotiations
on this basis continued between the political officer
and the Tashons without result.</p>

<p>In the beginning of December the chiefs agreed to meet
Major Raikes at Sihaung. The terms of the proclamation
were explained to them, and they were made to understand
that they were final and would be enforced. The chiefs
were impracticable. They affirmed that if our men advanced
they could not control their tribesmen. The ex-Sawbwa
of Kalè was present at this meeting, having come
down with the Chins. He wisely took the opportunity of
surrendering to Major Raikes, and was sent to Pakokku,
where he lived afterwards in receipt of a pension from the
Government. His surrender exploded a theory which had
been started, that the Tashons were holding out in order
to procure his reinstatement in Kalè.</p>

<p>A proclamation in similar terms was sent to the Haka
and Yokwa Chins.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the work of collecting transport and forwarding
stores was pushed on; the boat service on the Myittha
was organized, and was worked by Commander Holland
with great energy and success.</p>

<p>Brigadier-General Faunce had left Burma. He was
succeeded in command of the brigade by Colonel W. P.
Symons (well known as General Sir W. Penn Symons),
who met his death in the first action of the Boer War.
Colonel Symons had made his reputation already as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
active and able soldier. He was much more. He was
peculiarly fitted by temper, tact, and administrative ability
to conduct a difficult business like that now in hand. The
command of the Chin-Lushai expedition was given to him
by the Chief Commissioner's request. The question arose
whether he should have also the control of the negotiations
and arrangements with the Chins.</p>

<p>For some time the feeling in India had been, as it still
is, against the division of authority in expeditions of this
kind. No doubt, as a rule, the man who holds the military
command should have control of the negotiations also.
At the same time the circumstances of each case and the
qualifications of the man must be taken into account.
In Burma hitherto it had been found more convenient,
if not necessary, to divide the duties and to give what
is called the political business to a civil officer acquainted
with the language and customs of the people to be dealt
with. In the present instance it happened that Major
Raikes had from the beginning dealt, under the Chief
Commissioner's orders, with the Chin tribes. He had
had more opportunities than any one of acquiring a knowledge
of their character and politics. It was somewhat
difficult to ask him now to work in subordination to the
military commander who had had no part in the business.</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner was ready to brush aside this
personal difficulty and to allow Major Raikes to resign
his post if he preferred to go. He would willingly have
placed the chief authority unreservedly in General Symons's
hands. The question was carefully considered and discussed.
Finally, by General Symons's desire it was arranged
to leave to the civil officer the negotiations with the Chins
and the arrangements to be made with them when they
submitted. It happened, however, that before the advance
into the hills had well begun, Major Raikes was compelled
by illness to go away. General Symons was then put in
undivided control of the whole business, under the Chief
Commissioner's orders. Two civil officers were selected
to serve as his assistants, absolutely in subordination to
him. Mr. D. Ross was posted to the Southern Column
and Mr. B. S. Carey to the Northern. This arrangement
worked admirably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>The rains of 1889 were unfortunately late. The Southern
Column, 1,869<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> strong, was concentrated at Pakokku.
From Pakokku to Kan, which was to be the base for the
operations, was one hundred and sixty-five miles. Shelters
had been erected at the halting-places, and such provisions
as could be procured were gathered and stored by the civil
district officers. The troops began to move on the 23rd
of November, and the march was successfully carried out
in fifteen days, by detachments of one hundred fighting men
with followers marching in succession daily. The first
detachment left Pakokku on the 23rd of November, and
the leading columns were only just able to get through
the falling rivers and the drying country. The ground
was heavy and the heat great. Nevertheless, troops and
followers arrived at Kan in good condition, with only a
nominal sick list.</p>

<p>By the middle of November the Northern Column, 1,622<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
strong, was ready at Fort White and was waiting for the
hill-coolies who were to form the transport, before it should
move out.</p>

<p>The garrisons for the ten posts which were to protect
the frontier were sent up the Chindwin to Kalewa, and
had to march down the Myittha Valley. Late rains had
flooded the Kalè Valley, and as late as the end of November
the country was impassable to anything but an elephant.
On the 24th of October it took fifteen hours to get one
hundred and seventy fresh mules, with elephants to carry
their saddles and gear, through the bogs and swamps on
the last five and a half miles of the road into Kalemyo, which
was the distributing base for supplies for Fort White and
for the posts in the Kalè Valley. By the end of December
these ten posts were built, occupied, and rationed&mdash;a testimony
to the qualities of the officers and men who overcame
such difficulties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>By the end of January, 1890, five hundred and fifty-one
tons of stores had been sent by road to Kan, and six
hundred and thirty-eight tons landed at Kalemyo by
water. The river transport service not only did this, but
also provided, as a by-work, carriage for many men joining
their corps and for sick sent down to the rear. From the
beginning of February, when the country had become dry,
all supplies for the Southern Column were brought in carts
from Pakokku to Kan and on to Haka on hired pack-bullocks
and Government transport animals. To add to
the difficulties, virulent cattle disease broke out in the
Myittha and Kalè Valleys, and caused enormous loss.</p>

<p>One-third of the pack-bullocks had died. The sickness
was not confined to the transport animals. It was said
that the villagers in the Kalè State lost 90 per cent. of their
buffaloes.</p>

<p>The first troops of the Southern Column reached Kan
on the 7th of December. On the 9th the sappers, with a
covering escort, commenced work on the road to Haka,
which was sixty-four miles distant. Every one thought
that our men would be in Haka in ten or twelve days,
and all calculations were based on this estimate. It was
sixty-six days before the leading files entered Haka, and
the mule-road did not reach that place until the seventy-seventh
day. This, although the whole strength of the
force was devoted to road work: every man who could
dig was set to it. The country opposed to the engineers
a tumbled network of steep hills and deep ravines. The
climate proved deadly. Soldiers and coolies were ill with
fever. Out of seven Royal Engineer officers, at the end
of December six were lying ill. In comparison with the
difficulties caused by the nature of the country and the
climate, the fiercest opposition of the Chins was insignificant.</p>

<p>"This disappointing delay," wrote General Symons,
"was not without its compensating advantages in dealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
with the Chins. They expected us to make a quick advance,
do some damage, and retire. The steady, persistent advance,
together with the pains that were taken to get into touch
with them and to explain our objects and intentions,
paralysed their spirits and efforts for resistance, and thus
tribe after tribe submitted and yielded to our terms."</p>

<p>This is, no doubt, the true way of dealing with savages.
They are like children. They are terrified if they see a
person approaching them steadily, with measured steps and
outstretched arms. But it is much more difficult and
requires more resources in money and men and transport
to advance into a difficult country, making each step good
and permanent, than to rush in, burn, slay, and retire. The
latter method of warfare the savage understands. His
enemies appear suddenly, set fire to his village, kill those
they come across, and are away again. He flees into the
jungle at the first alarm, and comes back little the worse
as soon as the other side retires. That the better method
was not followed in 1887-8, and that the more barbarous
system was adopted, was not voluntary. Circumstances
forced it upon the authorities in Burma, as the only means
at their disposal for protecting the peaceful population in
the plains. Besides, it is only fair to say that the tribes
dealt with the former year, the Siyins and Kanhows, were
by far the most warlike and bloodthirsty of the Chins.
The severe chastisement inflicted on them, and the maintenance
of the garrison in Fort White during the year,
had brought home to all the folly of trying conclusions with
disciplined and well-armed troops.</p>

<p>On the 17th of December the advance-guard of the
Southern Column occupied Taungtek on the road to Haka.
From that date to the 28th of December the Chins from time
to time made feeble attempts to resist, harassing the troops
by firing into camp. On the 28th, near Taungtek, they
had a considerable number of men in action; according to
their own account five hundred men, of whom three
hundred had fire-arms. But they could do nothing. From
that day they gave up the fight and made no further
opposition.</p>

<p>On the 8th of January two Yokwa Chins came into
camp. The objects of our coming and the conditions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
peace were explained to these two men, and they were sent
back to repeat them to their chiefs. But therein lay the
difficulty. Who were the real chiefs? There were numbers
of chiefs, each with his own following, each bitterly jealous
of his fellows. To negotiate under such conditions required
the tact and patience which General Symons fortunately
possessed. The most intelligent and influential of the
rivals had to be discovered, and his position strengthened
by dealing through him.</p>

<p>Henceforth affairs progressed well, and there was no
combined opposition to the advance. One unfortunate
incident, however, occurred. Some Chins lying in ambush
shot Lieutenant Foster, of the King's Own Scottish
Borderers. The tribes had been fully warned that acts
of treachery would meet with punishment. The nearest
village was destroyed. This, happily, was the sole occasion
on which the Southern Column was compelled to use
violence.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards Yokwa was occupied, and this
section of the Baungshès yielded. The terms imposed on
them were the surrender of the captives, the payment of
a fine and of an annual tribute, and an engagement to keep
the peace in future. The mule-path, meanwhile, was being
pushed forward on to Haka, the headquarters of an
important section. The same tactics soon led to their
submission. The subjugation of the whole Baungshè clan
was now complete, for the minor sections followed the
lead of the premier communities. The headquarters of
the expedition were fixed henceforward at Haka, and
negotiations for the surrender of the captives were begun.</p>

<p>This was not an easy or speedy business. Nominal rolls
of the persons held in durance by the Chins had been
prepared, and it was known by which tribe and by which
village the captives had been taken. But some of the
raids had been committed months before. Slaves were
current coin in the hills, and passed from hand to hand
as easily as a bank-note in more civilized regions. Their
value was fixed with reference to the customary ransom
paid by their Burmese relatives, and seems to have averaged
ten or twelve pounds sterling. In barter, according to Mr.
Carey, a slave would exchange for three or four head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
cattle, a good gun, a dozen pigs, or a wife. However
willing the tribe or the village, or even the original captor,
might be to keep faith, it was often difficult to trace the
slave and obtain his release from the present holder, who
had bought him with a price and did not see why he should
be at a loss. A view not unreasonable from a Chin point
of view, but quite inadmissible from our side.</p>

<p>While these negotiations were proceeding at Haka, and
the mule-road was being completed to that place, reconnaissance
parties were sent out to the west, the country was
explored, the submission of a western tribe, the Klanklangs,
was secured, and communication with the Chittagong
Column, under Brigadier-General Tregear,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> was opened.
The advance parties of General Symons and General
Tregear's forces met on the 26th of February, at Tao village,
fifty-two miles west of Haka. This meeting was notable
for the recovery of the heads of Lieutenant John Stewart, of
the Leinster Regiment, and the soldiers (two British and
one Indian) who had been killed by Hoswata Shendoos on the
3rd of February, 1888, when surveying in the Chittagong
Hill tracts. Their skulls had decorated the village of some
Chin chief at Haka ever since. As to how they came to
Haka nothing is known. The chief may have taken them
himself, or he may have purchased the trophies from the real
heroes. No inquiry was made, and no retaliation was inflicted
on the accomplices in the murder of our fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>The Southern Column being thus engaged, the Northern
Column, under Colonel Skene, with Mr. Bertram Carey as
civil officer, had not been idle. Mr. Carey had to do with
a very difficult position. The tribes with whom he was
immediately concerned were as defiant in December, 1889,
as they had been a year before; and he had no medium
of communication with them. Gradually, by patience and
skilful handling, the Sagyilain Chins living in the nearest
villages were induced to bring supplies of eggs and fowls
to market. Trading led to closer intercourse. Mr. Carey
established himself at Yawlu on the road from Fort White
to Falam, the chief Tashon village, and very soon Tashons
as well as Sagyilains came to Yawlu daily to sell their
produce, and the situation became less strained, while the
troops procured better food. After a little Manglön, the
chief of the Sagyilains, came to see Mr. Carey, and made his
submission to the British Government. This was a most
welcome event. Manglön became a medium in all negotiations
with the Siyins, and remained loyal and trustworthy in
subsequent troubles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>No progress, however, was made with the Siyins, who
promised to surrender if the Tashons made peace. The
best months for active operations were passing. But it
was thought inexpedient to adopt rough methods against
them until a settlement had been made with the Tashons.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
After some negotiations with the chief of Mwebingyi (an
important village), who promised to surrender and invited a
visit, Mr. Carey, with Colonel Skene and a small force,
guided by Sagyilain men, marched to Mwebingyi. Three
miles from the village they were fired on by Chins from all
sides. A sharp skirmish followed. The Chins, driven back
to their village, set it on fire and took to the hillsides. We
lost two men severely wounded owing to this treacherous
attack.</p>

<p>The time had now come when the much-delayed advance
of the Southern Column made the combined movements of
the Northern and Southern Columns upon the Tashon
Ywama possible. The reduction of this tribe was the main
object of the campaign, to which all the other operations
were leading. It was important to avoid a hostile collision
with it. It would have been easy enough to harass and
punish the tribe village by village, but at the cost of life,
destruction of property, and misery. General Symons's
instructions were to accept no surrender and to conclude
no negotiations except at Falam, the Tashon head village;
and his purpose was to make resistance hopeless by placing
the forces from Haka and Fort White simultaneously on
the north and south of the Ywama. Accordingly, on the
8th of March a force 350 strong, with one gun, under
Colonel Skene, left Fort White. On the 9th General
Symons, with 290 rifles and two mountain-guns, marched
from Haka. The Southern Column had suffered so much
from sickness that its strength in fighting-men and transport
coolies had been seriously reduced. Without the aid
of the Northern Column, it could not have given enough
men to garrison Haka and at the same time to deal with
the Tashons. It was a matter of moment, therefore, that
the two columns should operate in concert. A successful
and rapid reconnaissance to within eight miles of the
Ywama was affected, and the two forces arrived on the
opposite banks of the Manipur, or Nankathe River, within
an hour of each other on the 11th of March.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>
<p>The Tashons had not intended to yield without a fight.</p>

<p>"Innumerable stockades, breastworks, and obstructions,
extending over some nine miles of country, but chiefly
intended against an enemy advancing from the north, had
been freshly erected at every commanding point. Large
numbers of armed men watched both columns as they
advanced, but there was no collision. It is difficult to
estimate their numbers; but on the south of Manipur River
near the Ywama there were not less than 5,000 men, of
whom two-thirds were armed with guns, the rest with
spears."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Disregarding the protests of some of the chiefs who came
out to meet him, General Symons marched his men to a
spot within one thousand yards of the Ywama, and fixed his
camp there. The chiefs were assembled and asked if they
agreed to our terms. With the inconsequence of savages,
after allowing us to advance unopposed, they rejected our
conditions, refusing firmly to pay tribute and demurring
even to the fine. General Symons warned them of the risk
they were incurring and dismissed them.</p>

<p>The scene on this occasion was dramatic, and is thus
described by Mr. Bertram Carey, who was present:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>
<p>"The whole valley, in which formerly lay the original
village of Falam, was full of armed Chins, numbering not
less than 3,000 men, gathered from all sides; the host
seemed to settle itself in groups of from 10 to 100 men.
They were quiet in demeanour, but held their heads high
and seemed quite prepared for whatever might be the result
of the negotiations. The crowd was a motley one, the
Tashon chiefs dressed in the gaudy tartan of the tribe, well
armed with bright guns, vermilion and black parti-coloured
dah scabbards, and beautifully inlaid powder-horns. The
Whenohs were conspicuous by their chignons, which
contrasted with the lofty head-dress of their neighbours,
the Yahows, who were present carrying the strange <i>shendu</i>,
chopper-shaped dahs in basketwork scabbards. Scattered
around in bunches were the scowling Siyins, the half-breeds
from Tawyan and Mintèdaung, the semi-independent
clique of Kwungli, and the trans-Nankathè tribesmen of
Sokte and 'Poi' origin. The congregation was armed
with a variety of weapons; spears and flint-lock guns
predominated, but bows and quivers of barbed arrows were
carried by not a few. Each man bore his food-supply for a
few days on his back."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The next two days were spent in wearisome negotiations
which might have driven a less patient man to the use of
force. His forbearance was rewarded, and the chiefs gave
way. The tribute for 1889 was delivered, and five thousand
rupees, the amount to which he had thought right to reduce
the fine, was paid.</p>

<p>The Tashons admitted that until a few days before the
forces reached Falam they had intended to fight. Their
position as head of the Chin tribes and the fear of losing
prestige impelled them to resist. When they found their
enemies coming from two sides, they began to lose heart.
All their outlying villages, who knew they must suffer first
and most, prayed them to make peace.</p>

<p>It is evident that the rough handling of the Siyins by
General Faunce had given a salutary lesson to these people.
The event proved also the wisdom of marching to the headquarters
of the tribe, and there compelling the public
submission of their leaders.</p>

<p>The object of the combined march having been attained,
the columns separated, the Southern returning to Haka
and the Northern to Fort White. During the remaining
months of open weather General Symons was occupied in
gathering in the captives, improving his relations with the
Chins, and in exploring the country. In April, accompanied
by the Haka chief, he visited many villages to the South
and was everywhere well received. On the 15th of April
General Tregear met him at Haka, now linked up with
Fort Tregear by a mule-track, which was brought into
Haka, a distance of eighty-one miles, on the 13th of April.
The Chittagong Column had met with no opposition.
Their work was mainly road-making, reconnoitring, and
surveying&mdash;work of the first importance in securing permanent
peace. The Lushai country was as difficult as any
on the Burma side.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>
<p>"There is the dense jungle, which prevents one seeing
a dozen yards ahead; rocks extending over large portions of
the hillside are constantly met with, and when it was found
impossible to avoid them much time was taken up in
blasting operations. Range upon range of precipitous hills,
running at right angles to the line of advance, had to be
crossed, and the question of a sufficient supply of water at
the different camps had to be considered in determining the
trace of the road."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Two large rivers had to be bridged.</p>

<p>It is not within the scope of the present narrative to
describe the work done by the Chittagong Column. Its
approach from the west had beyond doubt made General
Symons's task easier, and success more certain.</p>

<p>On returning to Fort White, Mr. Carey resumed his
immediate duty of bringing the Siyins within the fold.
They had promised to submit if the Tashons made peace.
He called upon them now to keep their word. Only one
chief came in, and, as he brought no captives, Mr. Carey
sent him away. So far from submitting, they cut the
telegraph wires daily and annoyed our people. A policy
of waiting and conciliation had failed. Several of the
worst villages were therefore singled out and destroyed, not
without some fighting, in which several sepoys were killed.
Unfortunately, in two cases, in which some troops from
Kalemyo were engaged, the bodies were allowed to fall
into the enemies' hands. The Chin braves were able to
return with two heads, more expressive of victory than guns
or standards, and no doubt published in their fashion jubilant
bulletins. The triumph was short-lived. A month afterwards
a detachment of the 42nd Gurkhas, marching down
on their way to India, destroyed the villages concerned.
Before the end of April all the Siyins had made outward
submission and had accepted our terms, which were that
a yearly tribute should be paid and that the captives should
be surrendered. Each clan was to be allowed to rebuild its
villages when the captives held by it had been released, and
not before. The cut telegraph wire and the two heads were
brought in, and the captives were being gradually surrendered.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>
<p>The results of the campaign were good and permanent.
The foundation was laid for an effective control over these
troublesome hill-men, and peace with security was given to
the Burmans in the plains and to the Chins themselves.
Raiding and slavery as institutions were condemned, and
were soon to disappear altogether. Before the troops left
the field one hundred and thirty-eight captives were liberated.
There were a few raids made after General Symons
finished his task, but they were promptly punished. There
were some disturbances among the Chin tribes. They
were easily checked, and systematic disarmament here, as in
Burma proper, changed the temper and habits of the people.</p>

<p>This success had been achieved almost without bloodshed,
but at a great cost to our men of suffering and loss of life
from disease. The sickness among troops and followers was
appalling, and the transport animals perished by hundreds.
Nine men, of whom two were officers, were killed in action;
two hundred and seven, of whom seventy-two were fighting-men,
perished of disease. And two thousand one hundred
and twenty-two were invalided, of whose seven hundred and
nine were fighting-men&mdash;one-fifth of the whole force.</p>

<p>A permanent post was built at Haka, which was found to
be a healthy place; and the headquarters of a civil officer,
with control over the Baungshès and Tashons, was established
there.</p>

<p>Fort White continued for some time to be the headquarters
of the civil and military staff in the north. But
the garrison was reduced, and as the site was always sickly,
the fort was moved back to the Letha Range, retaining the
name which it had received from Sir George White. Falam,
the chief village of the Tashons, is now the headquarters of
the civil administration of the Chin Hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>
<p>It is worth while, perhaps, to give some account of the
Chins in these the first years of British rule.</p>

<p>At the time of General Symons's expedition the Chins
were a savage race. They had arms in abundance, flint-lock
guns of English make, and spears. They were armed
not so much against strangers as against each other. In
former times, when they were ill-provided with fire-arms, the
Burmans used to oppress them; but for a long time the
position had been reversed. Intertribal feuds, however, and
feuds between villages and families of the same tribe, were
very common and made it unsafe to move without arms.
No man who owned a gun ever left his house without it.
While the fields were worked by women and slaves, armed
men stood guard. So it was even less than a century ago
in parts of India. What caused the feuds was a matter for
speculation. Apparently disputes about debts were the most
frequent; commerce, in fact, as among Western peoples,
led to quarrels. As for government, even the most primitive
form of tribal or village organization appears to have
been imperfect. There were many chiefs, and if any one of
them, as Jahoota,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> for instance, was pre-eminent, he could
not count on the obedience or support of the others. Their
jealousies interfered with everything. Of their manners and
customs not much was put on record in the earlier reports,
which were necessarily more concerned with military matters.
They made forays on the Burmans for heads and slaves.
They were much given to sacrifices, and sometimes to
human sacrifices. For example, it was usual to sacrifice
slaves at the funerals of persons accidentally killed. Of
their marriage-customs nothing is said in the early
reports.</p>

<p>The country was not rich. There were no forests that
it would pay to work, and no minerals had been discovered.
The cultivation was of the primitive kind&mdash;"Taungya," or
"Jhoom"&mdash;that is to say, felling the trees, burning them
when dry, and sowing hill-rice and other crops in the ash.
In the forests they had plenty of game, and much fish&mdash;Mahseer
and other kinds&mdash;in the rivers; and the jungles
were rich in fruits and roots that would support life if
the grain failed. Metal of all kinds was very scarce. The
hills produced none, and the Burmese Government had forbidden
the export of metals from the plains. The trouble
the Chins gave by cutting the telegraph wire was caused by
their desire to procure metal, rather than to cause annoyance.
Mr. Carey compared the attraction felt by the Chin for the
unprotected wire to that felt by an English boy for an
unfenced apple-orchard. The insulator spikes were beaten
into hoes and the wire melted to make bullets, or bangles
for the damsels. Their wants were blankets, cottons and
other cloths, iron and steel for tools, lead for bullets, needles
and thread and salt. In exchange they were able to offer
honey, beeswax, chillies, mats, and a little lac.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>
<p>The reports of 1889 were more concerned with the
measures carried out for their subjugation than with descriptions
of the people and their manners. In the main, what
is written in the <i>Burma Gazetteer</i> published in 1908 is true
of the Chins of twenty years ago:&mdash;</p>

<p>"They are a sturdy, warlike, hospitable people, slow of
speech, grave of habit, paying great regard to rank and
to the ties of clan, but spoilt by their intemperance, their
vindictiveness, their treachery, their greed, their lack of
persistence,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and their personal uncleanliness."</p>

<p>There is a quaint humour about this description which is
refreshing in a Gazetteer. A race would have to be good
indeed if, with such an array of vices, there was anything left
to spoil.</p>

<p>Their villages are described as built on the hill-slopes,
some of them fortified; and their houses are often solid,
elaborate structures. Their dress is the reverse&mdash;a loin-cloth,
none too ample, and a blanket for the men; a short skirt and
jacket for the women. Home-woven check plaids are seen
in a good many costumes, and some tribes have distinctive
plaids, as in Scotland. The people are mainly vegetarians,
but they will eat anything, from a dog to an elephant. They
smoke tobacco in pipes, and they make a liquor from
fermented grain, presumably rice, which is called <i>zu</i>. They
suck up this, in the most approved fashion, through a hollow
reed, out of the original still-pot. Enormous quantities of <i>zu</i>
are consumed at Chin entertainments, which usually end in
disgusting orgies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Chinbôks and Chinbons.</span></p>

<p>Tribes called the Chinbôks, claiming to be of the same
stock as the Hakas but speaking a different language, are
found at the head-waters of the Maw and Yaw Rivers.
Farther south, at the sources of the Saw and Salin and on
the eastern slopes of the Môn Valley, live the Yendus. Below
them, and southernmost of all the Chins, are the Chinbons,
who from the Môn on the east extend along the border of
the Mimbu district into the Akyab and Kyaukpyu districts
of Lower Burma.</p>

<p>These three tribes were less fierce than their kindred
to the north, and possessed only the arms of savage warfare&mdash;the
bow and arrow and spear. Some of them, those on the
borders of the Tilin township at the headquarters of the
Maw River, were noted for cattle-lifting. But the Chinbôks
on the Yaw and the Yendus on the Saw and Salin Rivers
rivalled the Siyins as slave-raiders. At the commencement
of the winter of 1889 there were twenty-one captives in the
possession of these tribes. They had made twelve raids
since December, 1888, in which five villagers had been killed
and sixteen carried off. Many had been wounded in resisting
or escaping, and large sums had been extracted as
ransom.</p>

<p>It was decided, in making up the account against these
savages, not to go back behind December, 1888. In that
month a notable raid had been committed on Taunggyo in
the Pauk township, in which thirty-two persons were carried
off and held to ransom at nine pounds sterling each, which
appears to have settled down as the sum beyond which the
ability or affection of the Burman would not go (see p. 318).
After this crime trade with the plains had been prohibited
to the Chinbôks, so far as lay in our power.</p>

<p>The difficulty in dealing with them lay in their want
of cohesion and the absence of any sort of tribal bond.
With the Shans there were the Sawbwas; with the Chins
to the north there were the tribal divisions, more or less
marked, with chiefs who could speak, or at any rate profess
to speak, for their people. But with the people with whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
we were now to come in contact there was an absence of
political organization beyond the village, which was usually
very small. It was necessary to visit as many as possible
of the villages concerned in the raids, to receive the submission
of each, and to impose fines for misconduct; and
as an obligatory condition to insist on the surrender of
captives, and the repayment of ransoms, not going back
farther than December, 1888. Substantial guarantees for
the future were also to be exacted.</p>

<p>It had been intended to make the dealings with these
three tribes part of the operations under General Symons's
control, and to give to Mr. Ross, under his orders, the
immediate conduct of the negotiations. When the full
proportions of the task assigned to General Symons were
seen, it became plain that he could not undertake the
Chinbôks; and in consequence of Major Raikes's illness,
Mr. Ross had to remain with the Southern Column.
Fortunately the Chin Frontier Levy had now been raised,
and had had a little time to fit itself for service. Their
posts at Kalemyo, Kan, and Gangaw were wanted by the
regular troops of the Southern Column. This freed the
Levy opportunely, and gave the Chief Commissioner a
sufficient force for the expedition into the Chinbok country.
An admirable officer was at hand to conduct it, in
Lieutenant R. M. Rainey (now Colonel Rainey-Robinson),
the Commandant of the Levy. To him was entrusted the
conduct of the business.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Rainey began, on the 16th of December,
1889, by dealing with twenty-one Chinbok villages,
consisting of two hundred and eighty-three houses,
situated on the Maw Chaung, the southernmost affluent
of the Myittha, on which Tilin, the headquarters of the
Tilin township, is situated. The claim against them
was for cattle stolen. But cattle thefts and slaves were
mere questions of accounts. They set up and proved a
counterclaim for the price of slaves sold to the plaintiffs
before the British occupation. Lieutenant Rainey thought
it best to admit the counterclaim and let bygones be
bygones, but to provide for the future. He induced the
twenty-one villages to appoint a chief as their spokesman
and agent in dealing with us, and to agree to pay a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
tribute in kind leviable from each village as an acknowledgment
of fealty to the British Government.</p>

<p>So far there had been no opposition. Lieutenant Rainey
then moved his headquarters from Tilin to Chaungu or
Yawdwin, some twenty miles south. This village is
situated on an affluent of the Yaw River, and made a good
base for the next part of the business. The Chins in the
valley of the Yaw and its tributaries were raiders. They
attempted to harass the force, and Captain Willcocks (now
Lieutenant-General Sir James Willcocks, K.C.M.G., C.B.,
D.S.O.), the Intelligence Officer, who was surveying and
reconnoitring for a further move to the south, was attacked.
This compelled a resort to punitive measures, and several
offending villages were destroyed. A defensible advanced
post was established at Chaungzon, in the heart of their
hills. These methods brought the hostile Chins to reason.
From this until the close of the operations the work
progressed, bloodless and unopposed. The villages submitted,
captives were delivered up, headmen were
appointed, and fines exacted from all villages which had
raided since December, 1888.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Rainey then returned to Chaungu; and
moving his base still farther south to Laungshe, came
into contact with the Yindus and Chinbons. By the
exercise of tact and patience he succeeded in bringing
these sections to submit to the British Government and
to release their captives. As before, headmen were
appointed, the payment of tribute was promised, and
guarantees for good conduct given. The work was
thoroughly well done. General Symons, in his despatch
on the Chin-Lushai Campaign, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Chinbok operations, though in no way under my
direction or command, but ably, even brilliantly, conducted
by Lieutenant Rainey, Commandant of the Chin Levy
Military Police Battalion, have squared well with our
work and settled an adjoining belt of country beyond our
capability to touch."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Rainey was another of the young soldiers
who aided the civil administration in difficult times and
showed their fitness for affairs. The country which submitted
to him was made a separate civil charge, known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
as "The Pakokku Hill Tracts," the headquarters of which
were for some years at Yawdwin and are now at Kanpetlet
on Mount Victoria.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that the Chinbôks and their confrères
had been excluded from trading and from all intercourse
with the plains since the beginning of 1889. On making
their submission they begged that the blockade might be
raised. It was evidently a useful weapon. If it had failed
in the case of the Tashons and the more northern tribes,
it was because it had not been effective.</p>

<p>We had now made ourselves felt by most of the tribes.
There remained unvisited a stretch of hills separating
the Minbu district of Upper Burma from Arakan. The
Chins dwelling in this tract preyed on the peasantry in
the neighbouring districts. During the preceding two years
sixteen villages had been raided in Minbu, twenty-one
persons killed and thirty-nine carried into slavery. Of
these captives sixteen had been ransomed by their friends
at a very heavy price. In the adjoining township of the
Pakokku district there had been several forays, and seventeen
persons had been captured and carried off. It was
not possible at this time to find men for a comprehensive
expedition against these Chins. Civil officers from the
three districts of Akyab, Kyaukpyu, and Minbu were
deputed, with small bodies of police, to meet at a central
point. They assembled the chiefs and village headmen.
The Chins were peaceful and submissive, but very few
of the captives were restored. These clans belonged to
the Akyab district geographically, and had not yet realized
that their eastern borders had come under the British
Government and were no longer to afford a happy hunting-ground
for the pursuit of human game. They were found
to be by no means formidable, badly armed, and little
inclined to fight.</p>

<p>The following year (1890-1) saw the beginning of the
systematic control of the Chin tribes. For administrative
purposes they were roughly divided into three parts. The
northern tribes were governed from Fort White, the
central tribes from Haka, and the southern from Yawdwin.
Captain F. M. Rundall commanded the garrison at Fort
White, and also held charge of our relations with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Chins when Mr. Carey had to take leave. Our knowledge
of these people was at first far from accurate, and the then
recognized divisions of the tribes controlled from Port
White were roughly as follows:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>1. The Siyins and Sagyilains who lived in five villages,
of which Koset, Sagyilain, and Tôklaing were the chief.
The first Port White was built on the site of Tôklaing,
which was afterwards given back to them when the fort
was moved.</p>

<p>2. The Kanhows, inhabiting between thirty and forty
villages north of Fort White, of which Tunzan, on the left
bank of the Manipur River, is the capital.</p>

<p>3. The Mobingyis, as they were called from the
Burmese name for their chief village, Molbem, which lies
on a spur overlooking the Manipur River on the left bank,
and was a very large village.</p>

<p>4. The Nwi-tes and other minor tribes akin to the
Kukis of Manipur.</p>

<p>It is now known that the right name of the Mobingyis
is Sok-te, a very large tribe, of whom the Kanhows are
only a powerful clan.</p>

<p>5. The Ngwite and Late, who occupy the hills between
Mwelpi and Manipur.</p>

<p>6. The Haitsi Lope, who live on the eastern slope of the
Letha Range bordering the Kabaw Valley.</p>

<p>At the end of the last season's operations Mr. Carey had
reported the submission of the Siyins and the acceptance of
our terms. At the same time he had little trust in their
good faith, and when Captain Rundall succeeded him at
Fort White their attitude was more or less hostile. They
continued to cut the telegraph wire and to give petty annoyance
to the troops. The capture of some of the wire cutters
gave some help to diplomacy. The Siyins submitted in
order to get their brethren released. They surrendered
their captives and agreed to pay tribute and keep the peace.
The Kanhows proved more difficult. Captain Rundall took
advantage of a dispute about the succession to the leadership
of the tribe to open communication with one of the
claimants.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>
<p>But before anything came of it the Kanhows raided a
Burman village, killing eight persons and carrying off
twelve. They were ordered to restore all captives, to give
up the heads taken in the raid, to pay a fine of Rs. 4,000, to
submit to the Government, and to bind themselves to pay
an annual tribute of Rs. 300. These terms were not complied
with. Captain Rundall, therefore, marched with three
hundred rifles and two guns against the village of Tungzang.
The Chins fought, and lost twelve men killed and twenty-one
prisoners, including some of their chief men. They
had now tried conclusions and were satisfied. Thirty-nine
captives were surrendered and the fine and tribute paid in
full. Some of the chiefs were sent to Rangoon, and shown
over some large steamers, mills, and the like, and, it is said,
were impressed by the sight. However that may be, they
have not given much trouble since. Some useful road work
was done during this year by the Madras Pioneers. A road
from Fort White to Falam, the Tashon mother-village, was
constructed. As the old site of Fort White still continued to
be very unhealthy, the garrison and headquarters of the
civil officer were moved back to a post hitherto known as
No. 5 Stockade on the Letha Range.</p>

<p>The Chins to be controlled from Haka were found to be
divisible into five tribes:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The Tashons, a large tribe having their headquarters
at Falam, half-way between Haka and Fort White.</p>

<p>2. The Hakas, lying south of the Tashon country and
round about Haka.</p>

<p>3. The Klanklangs, to the west of the Haka tribe and
between them and Fort Tregear, on the Chittagong side.</p>

<p>4. The Yokwas, who lie to the south and east of the
Hakas; and lastly,</p>

<p>5. The independent tribes, known generally by the nickname
of Baungshè, in the hills south of the Yokwas.</p>

<p>Mr. D. Ross,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> the Assistant Commissioner who had
accompanied General Symons's expedition, held Haka until
March, 1891, when he had to leave on account of his health.
He was succeeded by Mr. D. J. C. Macnabb,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Assistant
Commissioner, a young soldier of a well-known stock.
Friendly relations with the Chins were maintained. The
road from Kan, in the Myittha Valley, to Haka, was kept
open by Chin labour, and the regular postal service was
performed by Chins. The Myittha Valley was not raided,
and generally the Haka Yokwa tribes were well behaved.
Trouble, however, came from the independent Baungshès,
with whom, owing to their want of cohesion, it was difficult
to deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>General Symons had left one weak spot in his work.
There was a powerful village called Thetta, eight miles
south of Yokwa. Of it he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It has resisted all our efforts to bring it to complete
submission, although some captives have been given up and
a fine paid.... It is a blot on our work to have left this
village unsettled, but it commands the Kan to Yokwa road,
and I considered it better to leave it to stew in its obstinacy
and isolation rather than resort to drastic measures which
would have had the effect of driving the inhabitants into the
jungles and making the road unsafe. The boon of convoys
and traders and others being able to use safely and freely
the road between Kan and Haka without escorts was too
great to risk the loss of it for the satisfaction of an exercise
of our power which, at the best in my opinion, would have
had but little effect in bringing about the desired result."</p>

<p>At the same time he recorded his opinion that unless the
Thetta people gave in, the political officer would have to
visit and compel them.</p>

<p>It was the old story. The Thettas thought forbearance
was the sign of weakness and fear. In November, 1890,
they became openly hostile. They committed a series of
outrages, and at last brought matters to a head by killing
Mr. Wetherell, a young police officer, and attempting the
life of the political officer, Mr. Macnabb. In January, 1891,
a force of one hundred and forty rifles started from Haka
to punish the village. They had no guns. The village was
strongly stockaded. Lieutenant James, R.E., and two
Gurkha sepoys were killed, and the officer commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
decided that he could not storm the defences without heavy
loss. The Chins were invited to a parley, and they agreed
to pay a small fine for their misconduct and to yield an
annual tribute in future.</p>

<p>Such an arrangement was for us equivalent to a defeat.
It was decided to take up the coercion of the Baungshès in
a businesslike manner. Two strong columns, with guns,
were despatched, one from Haka with Mr. Ross as political
officer, the other from Gungaw with Mr. Macnabb. They
met at Thetta without opposition, and recovered the fine
which the Thetta villagers had promised to pay, and
traversed the Baungshè country, receiving the submission
of the villagers.</p>

<p>Thetta, however, was not yet subdued. They had defied
us, killed our men, and escaped with a small fine. In 1894
they began to rob and murder, and when they were called to
account they behaved themselves proudly. On the 1st of
January, 1895, a force under Major Keary, D.S.O., of the
6th Burma Rifles, with Mr. H. N. Tuck as political officer,
occupied the village, arrested the chiefs, and disarmed
the villagers. The chiefs were afterwards degraded in
open Durbar.</p>

<p>But the year 1891 was not to close without further
difficulty. General Symons, reporting to the Chief Commissioner
from Haka, dated the 1st of May, 1890, wrote
(para. 9):&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Klanklangs are almost a separate tribe, but they
are Baungshès and live on fairly good terms with the Hakas.
The Yokwas do not march with the Klanklangs, neither are
they friendly with them. (10) The Klanklangs, finding
themselves at the beginning of the year between the Burma
and Chittagong Columns, made haste to submit to the troops
entering their country, and readily agreed to easy terms
imposed. (11) The settlement with the Klanklangs and
their chief, Ya Hnit&mdash;whom, to suit the convenience of the
Chittagong officials, we are now agreed to call 'Jahoota'&mdash;was
very rightly left to me as the representative of the
local Government of Burma. The Klanklang Ywama
(chief village) is only sixteen miles from Haka, and Jahoota
and other head chiefs live there.... I do not think this
tribe will give us any more trouble. The meeting of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
Eastern and Western Columns in their territory, and the
continual passing of troops backwards and forwards without
committal of harm or excess, has had the best effect."</p>

<p>In March, 1891, Mr. Macnabb, with Lieutenant Mocatta
and one hundred rifles, set out to visit the Klanklangs and
to meet an official from Port Tregear at Tao. The tribe,
which had surrendered to General Symons, was held to be
friendly. The road passed through their hills, and there was
no thought of interfering with them. They had, however,
been raiding on the Lushai side, and it was intended to warn
them to abstain from this. On the outward march to Tao
the Klanklang chiefs did not appear. They were said to be
occupied in propitiating their <i>Nats</i>, or guardian spirits,
and to be very drunk. Mr. Macnabb, therefore, postponed
his interview until he came back from Tao. On the return
march a large body of Chins, said to have been seven or
eight hundred, suddenly fell upon the small column, which
fought its way on to Klanklang with some difficulty, losing
five men killed and ten wounded, and one British officer
(Lieutenant Forbes) wounded. Reinforcements from Haka,
under Colonel Mainwaring, met the returning column at
Klanklang and saved them from further loss. Officers and
men had behaved admirably. A fine of guns and money
was imposed on the tribe, and preparations were made for
enforcing it.</p>

<p>Before the preparations were complete Jahoota came
suing for peace. He proved that he had been away and had
had no concern in the treacherous attack, which had been
organized by two subordinate chiefs in his absence. He
brought in guns and other valuables in part payment of the
fine, and was ordered to produce the two offenders and to
raze their houses to the ground. As the culprits were not
surrendered, the political officer, with three hundred rifles,
visited Klanklang in May. He found that the houses had
been destroyed, but the two men had fled. Some of the
villages paid their shares of the fines; but others held out,
and owing to the lateness of the season and want of transport,
it was impossible to coerce them. Jahoota, in proof
of his good faith, gave up his eldest son as a hostage, and
he was left to re-establish his authority. There has been no
difficulty since in managing these Baungshè tribes, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
the years 1894-5 they, as well as all the southern tribes,
were disarmed.</p>

<p>The control of the rude southernmost Chins, known as
Chinbôks, Chinbons, and Yendus, was exercised at first by
a subdivisional officer stationed at Yawdwin. From
Lieutenant Rainey's expedition up to January, 1891, no
disturbance occurred. In that month a very daring raid
was made on Yawdwin itself, and the place looted under the
eyes of the police garrison. Further raids followed, and a
strong force of regular troops had to be sent to restore
order. A military post was established within the hills.
In 1896 this post also was attacked. The country was
then placed under efficient administrative control. Posts
were established in suitable places. A civil officer with
sufficient powers was appointed to live in the hills and
govern the people. His headquarters are now at Kanpetlet,
on the slopes of Mount Victoria, some 6,000 feet above the
sea-level. And a small force of Gurkha military police
under a British officer is maintained there. Raiding has
ceased, and the people have been disarmed. In other
respects twenty years have not changed them much. In
the <i>Burma Gazetteer</i> (of 1908, vol. ii. p. 393) it is
recorded:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The inhabitants of the tract are practically all animists.
The Chinbok men wear a very scanty loin-cloth, and are
seldom seen without their bows and arrows. The women's
dress consists of a smock and a short skirt. The females
have their faces tattooed."</p>

<p>It may be doubted whether Western civilization will make
them happier. Tattooing is more lasting and more conducive
to domestic peace than paint and powder. It is
cheaper in the long run.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

INTERNAL ADMINISTRATION OF BURMA</h2>


<p>Of the many other parts which go to make up the working
machinery of a great province nothing has been
said, as the object of this account is to show how peace and
order were restored, or rather given, to Burma. Along and
step by step with this rough work, however, every part
of an advanced administration began to take shape. There
was none which was not, at the very least, called into
existence.</p>

<p>The revenue of Upper Burma increased from £222,000
in 1886-7 to £1,120,000 in the year 1889-90. No new
taxes were imposed. The revenue grew by careful administration.
From the year 1888 I had the assistance of Mr.
Fryer as Financial Commissioner in dealing with this branch
of the work, and the subject of the land revenue of the
Upper Province was examined more minutely than had been
possible before. In 1889 a regulation declaring the law
relating to rights of land and formulating a complete system
of revenue law for Upper Burma was framed in Burma,
and passed by the Governor-General in Council. In it
provision was made for the gradual survey and assessment
of the land; and before the end of 1890 the cadastral survey
had broken ground in two districts in which the cultivated
area was largest.</p>

<p>The Forest Department had been busy from the first,
and progress had been made in ascertaining the condition
and resources of the great teak forests of Upper Burma.</p>

<p>The Government of India had treated Burma with
generosity in the matter of money for public works. The
extent of our undertakings was limited by the difficulty
of obtaining a competent staff, rather than by a deficiency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
of funds. The expenditure on barracks and other accommodation
for troops at stations where garrisons were to be
permanently kept was necessarily large. At district headquarters
in civil stations, court-houses, and (where necessary)
jails had been built, and court-houses had also been
provided in many subdivisions. The irrigation works in
Kyauksè were not neglected, and the Mu Canal scheme
in the Shwèbo district had been taken in hand. The railway
to Mandalay was opened in March, 1889, and the
surveys for the Mu Valley line, which was to take the rails
up the right bank of the river and through all the difficult
country traversed by Major Adamson's expedition in 1887-8,
had been completed and construction had begun.</p>

<p>Great attention had been paid to the improvement of
communications, including several difficult hill-roads. A
good cart-road had been made from the river to the ruby
mines. Another from Mandalay to Maymyo was being
taken on to Lashio; and, from Meiktila to Kalaw on the
Shan plateau, seventy-six miles, a road was well advanced.
The land-locked Yaw country had been opened up, and
a mule-track from Kalewa on the Chindwin to Fort White
in the Chin Hills had been finished. Roads over the Yomas,
which had sheltered the Magwè dacoits, had been completed.</p>

<p>The money, poured into the country for roads and buildings,
apart from the railway expenditure, was nearly all
spent on native labour and on material produced in the
country. In the aggregate it was more than the sums
received as revenue. That it, along with the railway
expenditure on labour, helped largely in settling the country
directly and indirectly, is certain. If Indian and Chinese
Shan coolies were employed, it was because Burman labour
was not forthcoming.</p>

<p>Nor had some of the refinements of administration been
neglected. In the larger towns a simple system of municipal
government was introduced, care being taken not to
hurry a somewhat primitive people accustomed to corrupt
methods and with little sense of responsibility along the
slippery paths of local self-government.</p>

<p>In the middle of 1890 a Judicial Commissioner was
appointed for Upper Burma. I accepted this refinement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
more reluctantly than I would have welcomed a reduction
of the garrison. But the character of the man appointed to
the post (the late Mr. Hodgkinson) was an assurance that
there would be no display of judicial pyrotechnics, such as
lawyers sometimes indulge in, and that some regard would
be paid to the conditions under which our officers were
working.</p>

<p>The provision of medical aid for the people was taken in
hand energetically, under the guidance of Dr. Sinclair, who
administered the medical department of the whole of Burma.
It was not possible to provide substantial public hospitals,
and at first only temporary buildings were erected. Excellent
permanent hospitals had been built for the military
police, and on their withdrawal it was intended that these
buildings should be converted into civil hospitals.</p>

<p>Vaccination was introduced also, and every district was
furnished with the means of protection against smallpox.
The people came readily to be vaccinated, and no Burman,
so far as I know, expressed an objection, conscientious or
other, to being protected from the ravages of a loathsome
disease. But they are comparatively a backward race and
still have much to learn.</p>

<p>In the matter of education, it was not the time to do much,
and I was inclined to walk very warily in Upper Burma.
The Director of Public Instruction was sent round the
province in 1889 to examine the condition of the existing
schools; and on his report a beginning was made by appointing
an inspector and some assistant inspectors, more to
ascertain and collate facts than with a view to active interference.
Later on the grant-in-aid rules in force in the
lower province were introduced. The author of the <i>Burma
Gazetteer</i> (vol. i., p. 132) writes: "Missionary schools are
now plentiful, and lay schools, both public and private,
abound; but the bed-rock of vernacular education in Burma
is still monastery teaching, and with it is intimately bound
up the educational welfare of the people."</p>

<p>I am inclined to agree with this statement. The system
of monastic schools has, I think, been an immense boon
to the people of Burma, and if only the monks could be
roused to educate themselves more and to cast off some
of their old ideas I should like to see it maintained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>The danger is that the contact with Western knowledge
and ascertained fact may destroy the belief of the young
Burmans in the monastic teaching, and this danger is
increased, if it is not caused, by the superstitious ignorance
of the monks and their inability to disentangle the moral
teaching of their great founder from the cobwebs of fairy
tales, about the form and nature of the earth and the like.
With this in mind, a beginning was made towards inducing
the Pongyis to employ certificated assistant teachers in
the monastic schools.</p>

<p>Western teaching may, however, have less effect on
Eastern faiths than we think. I was visiting a lay school in
Burma one day, I forget where, but I was talking to one of
the pupils, a very intelligent boy. I asked him about the
shape of the earth, and so on. He had it all pat, the
conventional proofs included. I said: "Now, you know
what the Pongyis teach, which do you believe&mdash;what you
have learnt here, or in the monastery?" He replied unhesitatingly,
"What the Pongyis tell me, of course." "Why
then," I asked, "did you say the earth was round and
went round the sun?" "Oh," he said, "I must say that
or I should not pass the examinations; but I believe the
other." There may be more intelligent students, even at
a riper age, of the same mind as this boy. Sometimes,
perhaps, in the West, it is the other way about.</p>

<p>On the 10th of December, 1890, I surrendered my charge
to Sir Alexander Mackenzie,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> one of the ablest men of
his time in India.</p>

<p>In his summary of the Administration Report of Burma,
for the year 1890-1, dated December 21, 1891, is written:
"Upper Burma being now perfectly tranquil, it is not
necessary to describe separately the progress made in the
pacification of each district. The fact that there were
fewer crimes in Upper than in Lower Burma during the year
is sufficient proof that except in certain frontier tracts the
work is complete."</p>

<p>It is pleasant to most of us to know that our work is
appreciated by others. It pleased me the other day, and
it may please those for whom I have put together this
rough account of the pacification of Burma to read this
passage from the "Shans at Home," by Mrs. Leslie Milne
and the Rev. Wilbur Willis Cochrane (p. 29):&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>
<p>"At the time of the annexation, every part of the Shan
highlands west of the Salween was ravaged with war,
Shans against Shans and Burmans against them all. To
bring peace and an era of prosperity, put an end to feuds,
settle the disputes of princes, re-establish the people in their
homes, and organize out of chaos a helpful and strong
government was no easy task. That it was accomplished
with so small a force, so quickly and with so little opposition,
was due to the energy, ability, and tact of the British
officials upon whom the Government had placed responsibility.</p>

<p>"Immediately after the annexation, began the era of improvement.
Twenty-four years have passed since then. The
British peace officers have retired, or are retiring, but they
leave behind them a prosperous and peaceful people. The
towns are growing towards their former dimensions; wealth
and trade are increasing beyond all expectations. Population
is rapidly increasing. A mother with her little child can
travel alone from Mogaung to the border of Siam, and from
Kengtung to Rangoon, with comfort and perfect safety."</p>
